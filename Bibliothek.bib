	abstract = {Modelling of carbon turnover is a widely used tool to estimate soil carbon stock changes as a response to climate and land-use change. Carbon turnover models are increasingly used not only at the point scale but also at regional and continental scales, and the Rothamsted carbon model ({RothC}) is a widely used model because of its simplicity and easy implementation. For the initialization of the {RothC} model, knowledge about the carbon pool sizes is essential. Pool size characterization can be either obtained from physical fractionation or equilibrium model runs, but both approaches are time consuming and tedious, especially for larger scale simulations. In our study, a pedotransfer function ({PTF}) for the estimation of all active carbon pools of the {RothC} model is presented. As independent variables, only total organic carbon ({TOC}) and clay content, which are easily available at most scales, are necessary. For validation of {PTFs} the resistant plant material ({RPM}) stock estimated from physical fractionation of soil of a wide range of types was predicted with a R2 of 0.70. In a second step, associated errors induced by the use of {PTFs} were analysed by using simulation runs for a 100-year time period. Thereafter, the model was either initialized by the carbon pools extracted from physical fractionation or the {PTF}. Maximum relative deviations in {TOC} content were small ({\textless}9\%) and declined to {\textless}4\% after 100 years. Further, absolute errors were within the range of measurement error for soil organic carbon. Therefore, we propose that {PTFs} can be used to initialize the {RothC} model whenever physical fractionation is not feasible or equilibrium runs are considered too tedious.},

Root crops are significant in agro-ecosystems of temperate climates. However, the amounts of crop residues for these crop types are not well documented and they need to be accounted for in the modeling of soil organic carbon dynamics. Our objective was to review field measurements of root biomass left in the soil as crop residues at harvest for potato and sugar beet. We considered estimates for crop residue inputs as root biomass presented in the literature and some unpublished results. Our analysis showed that compared to, for example, cereals, the contribution of below-ground net primary productivity ({NPP}) to crop residues is at least two to three times lower for root crops. Indeed, the field measurements indicated that root biomass for topsoils only represents on average 25 to 30 g dry matter ({DM}) m−2 yr−1. Other estimates, albeit variable and region-specific, tended to be higher. We suggest relative plant {DM} allocation coefficients for agronomic yield ({RP}), above-ground biomass ({RS}) and root biomass ({RR}) components, expressed as a proportion of total {NPP}. These coefficients, representative for temperate climates (0.739:0.236:0.025 for potato and 0.626:0.357:0.017 for sugar beet), should be useful in the modeling of agro-ecosystems that include root crops.},

Comparisons of food composition data published decades apart are not reliable. Over time changes in data sources, crop varieties, geographic origin, ripeness, sample size, sampling methods, laboratory analysis and statistical treatment affect reported nutrient levels. Comparisons with matching archived soil samples show soil mineral content has not declined in locations cultivated intensively with various fertilizer treatments. Contemporaneous analyses of modern versus old crop varieties grown side-by-side, and archived samples, show lower mineral concentrations in varieties bred for higher yields where increased carbohydrate is not accompanied by proportional increases in minerals – a “dilution effect”. Apparent declines, e.g., the extreme case of copper from −34\% to −81\%, represent small absolute changes: per 100g dry weight vegetables have 0.11–1.71mg (1555\% natural range of variation), fruit 01–2.06mg (20,600\% range), and grains 0.1–1.4mg (1400\% range); copper composition is strongly subject to the dilution effect.

A diet high in fruit and vegetables has been linked to optimal health in a variety of studies. One vegetable that has gained popularity is the carrot due in part to the introduction of “cut \& peel” convenience packages. Although most people in the United States know carrots as an orange vegetable that can be eaten raw or in a variety of cooked dishes, original carrots were yellow and purple. These carrot varieties are currently undergoing phenotypic recurrent selection to improve the profile of compounds considered to be beneficial. This process is called biofortification, which has increased provitamin A content by {\textgreater}40\% since 1970. The most novel carrot produced to date is an orange–purple–red variety that not only contains provitamin A activity as α- and β-carotene, but also contains anthocyanins and the nonprovitamin A carotenoid lycopene, of which both are potent antioxidants. A functional food is one that provides benefit beyond basic nutrition. Biofortified carrots of many colors not only provide vitamin A, but may contribute to optimal health. Because supplements have not been shown to be overly beneficial, except for correcting deficiencies, whole food-based approaches to enhance health by utilizing functional foods such as biofortified carrots should be considered.},

	abstract = {Choline is an essential nutrient and choline esters are potential functional food ingredients. We aimed to analyze the choline compound content in 19 cultivated fruits and vegetables and identify those with high acetylcholine content. We utilized liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to quantify choline compounds according to the standard addition method. Choline compounds were extracted from lyophilized fruit/vegetable powders and passed through a weakly acidic cation exchange column, resulting in a concentrated solution of choline compounds. The compounds were separated on a pentafluorophenyl column and then analyzed using positive mode electrospray ionization. Results showed that acetylcholine and choline were the primary choline compounds in all agricultural products; propionylcholine and butyrylcholine were minor compounds in 17 and 12 agricultural products, respectively. The acetylcholine concentration was 2900-fold higher in eggplants (6.12 mg/100 g fresh weight [{FW}]) than in other agricultural products (average: 2.11 × 10−3 mg/100 g {FW}). The concentration of acetylcholine differed only 2-fold between eggplant cultivars with the highest (′Higomurasaki′: 5.53 mg/100 g {FW}) and lowest (′Onaga nasu′: 2.79 mg/100 g {FW}) concentrations. The half-life of acetylcholine in eggplants was approximately 16 days, which is longer the shelf life of eggplants. Thus, eggplants can be a good source of acetylcholine.},

	abstract = {Plant carbon (C) inputs via shoot, roots, and the associated mycorrhizal fungi are vital drivers of soil organic C ({SOC}) stock and turnover. Both the amounts and proportions of plant C inputs to the soil through these pathways can be affected by soil fertility. Yet, we know little about how divergent pathways of plant C inputs contribute to {SOC} cycling under different soil fertility. By growing the C4 grass Cleistogenes squarrosa in C3 soils, we quantified the contributions of shoot, roots, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ({AMF}) to {SOC} turnover with different fertility in a temperate grassland. Our four-year field experiment showed that soils with higher fertility sequestered more shoot-, root- and {AMF}-derived C, which were mainly driven by greater soil microbial biomass. Irrespective of soil fertility, roots contributed the most (44\%) to new {SOC} formation, while shoot (28\%) and {AMF} (28\%) exerted similar but lower contributions. We found that the positive priming effects induced by roots and {AMF} were greater in more fertile soils, which were primarily associated with more root- and {AMF}-derived C, respectively. Across all the soil fertility levels, root pathway had an equal impact on new {SOC} accumulation and native {SOC} losses via priming effects, and thus caused no net {SOC} changes. However, the priming effect induced by {AMF} pathway was 60\% higher than the root pathway across treatments. The disproportionately large priming effects relative to new {SOC} accumulation induced by {AMF} led to net {SOC} losses, especially in soils with higher fertility. Overall, we demonstrated that plant C inputs through shoot, root, and mycorrhizal pathways have differential impacts on {SOC} turnover. Our quantitative estimation should be valuable for more accurately modeling how much plant-derived C can be sequestered in the soils and advancing our understanding of future {SOC} dynamics under global changes.},

	abstract = {The current interest in characterizing, predicting and managing soil C dynamics has focused attention on making estimates of C inputs to soil more accurate and precise. Net primary productivity ({NPP}) provides the inputs of carbon (C) in ecosystems and determines the amount of photosynthetically fixed C that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. We present a method for estimating {NPP} and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n=168). Mean S:R ratios for annual crops were highest for small-grain cereals (7.4), followed by corn (5.6) and soybeans (5.2), and lowest for forages (1.6). The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of ∼50\% for annual crops and ∼75\% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground {NPP} ({BNPP}) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The {BNPP} (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops (∼20\% of {NPP}) than for perennial forages (∼50\%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields. It can be readily up-dated with new experimental results and measurements of parameters used to quantify the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetically fixed C in different types of crops.},

Unlike the method of distribution keys, which is widely used in similar models, the suggested procedure accounts for adaptive plant responses to both uncontrolled weather conditions and mineral nutrition.

	abstract = {Despite its fundamental role for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, rhizodeposition remains ‘the hidden half of the hidden half’: it is highly dynamic and rhizodeposits are rapidly incorporated into microorganisms, soil organic matter, and decomposed to {CO}2. Therefore, rhizodeposition is rarely quantified and remains the most uncertain part of the soil C cycle and of C fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. This review synthesizes and generalizes the literature on C inputs by rhizodeposition under crops and grasslands (281 data sets). The allocation dynamics of assimilated C (after 13C-{CO}2 or 14C-{CO}2 labeling of plants) were quantified within shoots, shoot respiration, roots, net rhizodeposition (i.e., C remaining in soil for longer periods), root-derived {CO}2, and microorganisms. Partitioning of C pools and fluxes were used to extrapolate belowground C inputs via rhizodeposition to ecosystem level. Allocation from shoots to roots reaches a maximum within the first day after C assimilation. Annual crops retained more C (45\% of assimilated 13C or 14C) in shoots than grasses (34\%), mainly perennials, and allocated 1.5 times less C belowground. For crops, belowground C allocation was maximal during the first 1–2 months of growth and decreased very fast thereafter. For grasses, it peaked after 2–4 months and remained very high within the second year causing much longer allocation periods. Despite higher belowground C allocation by grasses (33\%) than crops (21\%), its distribution between various belowground pools remains very similar. Hence, the total C allocated belowground depends on the plant species, but its further fate is species independent. This review demonstrates that C partitioning can be used in various approaches, e.g., root sampling, {CO}2 flux measurements, to assess rhizodeposits’ pools and fluxes at pot, plot, field and ecosystem scale and so, to close the most uncertain gap of the terrestrial C cycle.},

	abstract = {The Rothamsted Carbon Model ({RothC}), models the turnover of soil organic carbon (C) in non-waterlogged topsoils. It requires only easily obtainable inputs, and has been widely and successfully used in many regions of the world. However, it has been shown to have limitations when used to predict soil C dynamics in semiarid areas, where unrealistically high C inputs have been required to obtain good simulations. Soils of semiarid regions, highly vulnerable to soil C depletion, could represent a sink of C and become economically valuable in the C credit market. Hence, we introduced modifications to {RothC} with the aim of improving the prediction of soil C dynamics for semiarid regions. Modifications made were: i) the minimum value of the rate modifying factor for moisture was changed from 0.2 to 0.15 and 0.10 (indicated with the suffix 20, 15 and 10, respectively, in the name of the model); ii) the maximum soil moisture deficit was increased and the hydrological constants (field capacity, wilting point and hygroscopic water) were calculated using pedotransfer function by van Genuchten (1980) ({RothC}20, {RothC}15, and {RothC}10); and iii) soils that were bare were allowed to dry out more than in the current version of {RothC} ({RothC}\_N, {RothC}20\_N, {RothC}15\_N, and {RothC}10\_N). The modifications were tested on data from six experiments: five sites from semiarid regions and one from a temperate region. The modifications made in this study, which essentially reduce decomposition rate in soil, improved the model's performance for dry regions, especially when the rotation included a fallow. The model now requires more realistic C inputs to the soil, and one additional input (silt) that is normally measured with clay. These modifications do not impair the performance of the model under temperate conditions and so represent a broadening in the capability of the {RothC} model. Among all the various models compared, for simulation of {SOC} turnover we suggest the use of {RothC}10\_N for dry regions as a part of global scale modelling.},

	abstract = {One of our current challenges is to quantify the mechanisms, capacity, and longevity of C stabilization in agricultural lands. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term (10 yr) role of C input in soil organic carbon ({SOC}) sequestration and to identify underlying mechanisms of C stabilization in soils. Carbon input and {SOC} sequestration, as governed by crop management strategies, were assessed across 10 Mediterranean cropping systems. Empirically derived relationships between yield and aboveground plus belowground crop biomass as well as estimates of C contributions from crop residues and manure amendments were used to quantify cumulative C inputs into each cropping system. Soil samples were separated into four aggregate size classes ({\textgreater}2000, 250–2000, 53–250, and {\textless}53 μm) and into three soil organic matter ({SOM}) fractions within the large ({\textgreater}2000 μm) and small (250–2000 μm) macroaggregates. Aggregate stability increased linearly with both C input (r2 = 0.75, p = 0.001) and {SOC} (r2 = 0.63, p = 0.006). Across the 10 cropping systems, annual soil C sequestration rates ranged from −0.35 to 0.56 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 We found a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.70, p = 0.003) between {SOC} sequestration and cumulative C input, with a residue-C conversion to {SOC} rate of 7.6\%. This linear relationship suggests that these soils have not reached an upper limit of C sequestration (i.e., not C saturated). In addition, C shifted from the {\textless}53-μm fraction in low C input systems to the large and small macroaggregates in high C input systems. A majority of the accumulation of {SOC} due to additional C inputs was preferentially sequestered in the microaggregates-within-small-macroaggregates ({mM}). Hence, the {mM} fraction is an ideal indicator for C sequestration potential in sustainable agroecosystems.},

The right combination of soil fertility factors in organic farming is essential to enhance soil organic C ({SOC}) sequestration. A field trial experiment was overlaid on an long term organic farming experiment, in Monsampolo del Tronto (42° 53′ N, 13° 48′ E) in Central Italy, based on a 4-years rotation, with 6 main crops, and 3 different {ASCs}. The treatments included: i) the alternative termination of the cover crop (barley) with roller crimper technique compared to green manure and ii) the application of compost (not applied before) in different doses. The barley managements were: green manure ({GMB}); flattened ({FB}) by the use of a roller crimper; no barley ({NB}) as control. The compost (Cp) doses were: 0, 15 and 30 Mg C ha−1 to study the effect on soil C dynamics of compost application and {ASCs} termination techniques. The historic and experiment results were used as input to run a soil C dynamics model ({RothC}10N) to predict the effect of the factors different combinations in a medium term (20 years). After two years from compost application, the {SOC} stock increased in all plots, by +1.8, +2.3 and +4.9 Mg C ha−1 for Cp0, Cp15 and Cp30 respectively, compared to the initial stock of 36.8 Mg ha−1. The effect of different {ASCs} termination and {ASC} × compost interaction was not statistically significant. The {RothC}10N model was used to predict the effect of {ASCs} ({NoASCs}, {FB} and {GMB}) and Cp doses in a 20 years period. Predictions of the calibrated and validated {RothC}10N model showed that {SOC} change in 20 years was negative in the scenario with no {ASCs}-no compost ({NoASC} Cp0), where the C inputs were not sufficient to offset C losses, whereas positive values were predicted for all the other scenarios. The average values of predicted C stock change in 20 years were 3.8, 13.3 and 19.8 Mg C ha−1 for {NoASC}, {FB}, and {GMB} respectively and 8.2. 12.2 and 16.5 Mg C ha−1. for Cp0, Cp15 and Cp30. Both field experiment and model showed that the green manure of {ASC} and compost application represent a valid option in terms of carbon sequestration increase. {RothC}10N model can be used successfully as a tool to compare the C sequestration potential of alternative agronomic practices.},

Equating these 3 fractions with the resistant plant material, inert organic matter, and humic pools of the model, respectively, gave good agreement between measured and modelled data for 2 long-term rotation trials in Australia using a soil depth of 30 cm. At one location, Brigalow Research Station in Queensland, there were 3 distinct soil types, two clays and a duplex soil, in a semi-arid, subtropical climate. At this site, continuous wheat with some sorghum was established after clearing land under brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) and continued for 18 years. The second location was near Tarlee, South Australia, and was established on existing agricultural land. One soil type (red brown earth) with 2 rotations (continuous wheat and wheat–fallow) were available over a period of 8 years. The modelled and measured data were in good agreement for both locations but the level of agreement was substantially improved when the resistant plant material decomposition rate was reduced from 0.3 to 0.15/year. No other modifications were required and the resulting values provided excellent agreement between the modelled and measured data not only for the total soil organic carbon but also for the individual pools. Using this fractionation scheme therefore provides an excellent means of initialising and testing the Rothamsted model, not only in Australia, but also in countries with similar soil types and climate. For the first time, the work reported here demonstrates a methodology linking measured soil carbon pools with a conceptual soil carbon turnover model. This approach has the advantage of allowing the model to be initialised at any point in the landscape without the necessity for historical data or for using the model itself to generate an initial equilibrium pool structure. The correct prediction of the changing total soil organic carbon levels, as well as the pool structure over time, acts as an internal verification and gives confidence that the model is performing as intended.},

They represent 33–56\% of cultivated vegetable species, and occupy 6\% of world vegetable cropland. Despite their distinct relevance to climate change mitigation and nutritional security, perennial vegetables receive little attention in the scientific literature. Compared to widely grown and marketed vegetable crops, many perennial vegetables show higher levels of key nutrients needed to address deficiencies. Trees with edible leaves are the group of vegetables with the highest levels of these key nutrients. Individual “multi-nutrient” species are identified with very high levels of multiple nutrients for addressing deficiencies. This paper reports on the synthesis and meta-analysis of a heretofore fragmented global literature on 613 cultivated perennial vegetables, representing 107 botanical families from every inhabited continent, in order to characterize the extent and potential of this class of crops. Carbon sequestration potential from new adoption of perennial vegetables is estimated at 22.7–280.6 {MMT} {CO}2-eq/yr on 4.6–26.4 Mha by 2050.},

	abstract = {Substrate composition is one of the most important factors influencing the decomposition of plant residues in soils. The interaction of organic residue biochemistry with residue decomposition rates, soil aggregation and soil humus composition was determined in a laboratory experiment. Addition of seven different organic residues (2\% w/w alfalfa, oat, canola, clover, soybean, corn and prairie grasses) to a Webster soil resulted in a rapid, transient increase in aggregate mean weight diameters ({MWD}) when incubated for 9 d with residues with low phenolic acid content (alfalfa, canola and clover) and was inversely correlated with soil carbohydrate content (r=−0.63). More pronounced improvement in aggregate size was noted upon increased incubation to 84 d with organic residues higher in phenolic acid content (corn, prairie grasses, oat and soybean) and was related to soil phenolic acid (r=0.65) and soil carbohydrate content (r=0.70). Total plant residue phenolic acid content was related to {MWD} measured after incubation for 84 d by a quadratic response and plateau function (r=0.96) and the {MWD} quadratically increased with an increase in vanillin-vanillic acid concentrations in the plant residues (r=0.997). Soil organic C after 84 d was related to the {MWD} (r=0.82) and the residue's vanillin-vanillic acid content (r=0.86), suggesting that C remaining in the soil following decomposition maybe related to the specific phenolic acid content. The results suggest that transient aggregate stability initiated by microbial decomposition of the carbohydrate and amino acid content of the residue, is then strengthened by the interaction with phenolic acids such as vanillin or vanillic acid released by microbial decomposition from residues structural components.},

	abstract = {Plant carbon (C) content is one of the most important plant traits and is critical to the assessment of global C cycle and ecological stoichiometry; however, the global variations in plant C content remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a global analysis of the plant C content by synthesizing data from 4318 species to document speciﬁc values and their variation of the C content across plant organs and life forms. Plant organ C contents ranged from 45.0 \% in reproductive organs to 47.9 \% in stems at global scales, which were signiﬁcantly lower than the widely employed canonical value of 50 \%. Plant C content in leaves (global mean of 46.9 \%) was higher than that in roots (45.6 \%). Across life forms, woody plants exhibited higher C content than herbaceous plants. Conifers, relative to broad-leaved woody species, had higher C content in roots, leaves, and stems. Plant C content tended to show a decrease with increasing latitude. The life form explained more variation of the C content than climate. Our ﬁndings suggest that speciﬁc C content values of different organs and life forms developed in our study should be incorporated into the estimations of regional and global vegetation biomass C stocks.},

Studying carbon and nitrogen distributions in plant and soil is important for our understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and carbon cycle on arid lands. A study was conducted in a typical arid area, the Yanqi Basin, Northwest China. Carbon and nitrogen distributions in plant tissues and soil profiles were determined at 21 sites with typical native plants and crops. Our results indicated that carbon content was similar between crops and native plants, and the average carbon contents in aboveground (42.4\%) and belowground (42.8\%) tissues were almost the same. Average nitrogen contents in crops were nearly the same ({\textasciitilde}0.7\%) in aboveground and belowground tissues whereas mean nitrogen content was approximately 100\% higher in aboveground (2.2\%) than in belowground (1.2\%) tissues for native species. Soil organic carbon ({SOC}) and total nitrogen ({TN}) in cropland (9.4 and 0.9 g kg-1) were significantly higher than those in native land (6.2 and 0.7 g kg-1). Multiple regression analyses indicated that carbon content in belowground tissue and nitrogen content in aboveground tissue were key factors connecting plant and soil in native land. However, there was no significant relationship for carbon or nitrogen between soil and crop, which might reflect human disturbance, such as plowing and applications of various organic materials.},

	abstract = {The methods used for estimating below-ground carbon (C) translocation by plants, and the results obtained for different plant species are reviewed. Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify root-derived C are discussed: pulse labeling, continuous labeling, and a method based on the difference in 13C natural abundance in C3 and C4 plants. It is shown, that only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole below-ground C translocation. This included roots, exudates and other organic substances, quickly decomposable by soil microorganisms, and {CO}2 produced by root respiration. Advantages due to coupling of two different tracer techniques are shown. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between plant species (cereals, grasses, and trees) are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20\%—30\% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in {CO}2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of rootborne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter. The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30\%—50\% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1500 kg C ha—1), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1500 and 2200 kg C ha—1, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived {CO}2 efflux from the soil.},

	abstract = {Simulating cropland soil carbon changes following a reduction in tillage intensity is necessary to determine the utility of this management practice in climate change mitigation. In instances where reduced or no tillage increases soil carbon stocks, this is typically due to reduced decomposition rates of plant residues. Although some soil carbon models contain a priori decomposition rate modifiers to account for tillage regime, these are typically not calibrated to specific climatic regions, and none are currently available for the Rothamsted Carbon Model ({RothC}). Here, we present a modelling framework to estimate a tillage rate modifier ({TRM}) for the decomposition rate constants in {RothC}-26.3 which determine decay between soil carbon pools. We demonstrate this for north-west Europe, using published data assembled through a recent systematic review with propagation of error from input parameters throughout the framework. The small magnitude of soil carbon change following a reduction in tillage intensity in this region is reflected in our {TRM} estimates for no-till of 0.95, with 95\% Credible Intervals [0.91, 1.00], and reduced tillage of 0.93 [0.90, 0.97], relative to conventional high-intensity tillage with a default {TRM} of 1. These {TRMs} facilitate realistic simulation of soil carbon dynamics following a reduction of tillage intensity using {RothC}, and our simple, transparent, and repeatable modelling framework is suitable for application in other climatic regions using input data generalisable to the context of interest.},

	abstract = {Humus-balancing methods are simple tools for the assessment of interactions between agricultural land use and soil organic matter ({SOM}). Aside from this commonality, approaches for humus balancing differ considerably with regard to their specific aim, scope, and methodical approach. The term “humus balance” covers both simple models to quantify {SOM} change in arable soils, or soil organic C ({SOC}) change in particular, and models that refer to the optimization of soil productivity in arable soils by calculating organic-fertilizer demand, without quantifying {SOM} or {SOC} change. This situation naturally has caused much discussion and misunderstandings. Against this background, the aim of this review is to systematically explore the different methodical approaches to humus balancing in order to contribute to a more sophisticated discussion of this model family, its opportunities, and limitations. As humus balancing has long history as well as special actual relevance in Germany, and, lately Switzerland, we focus on these countries and discuss the different approaches that are presently available and applied there. We argue that humus balances can be roughly categorized into “ecological” and “agronomical” approaches based on their specific concepts and methodology. Ecological humus balances comprise a strong link to quantitative {SOM} change, while humus balances of the agronomical family refer to the maintenance of soil productivity without a quantitative link to {SOM} change. Lately, some models have been presented that link the two concepts. However, we identify that humus-balancing methods often are insufficiently validated, partly because the validation of agronomical humus balances is not easily possible without a very comprehensive field-experimental basis. Further, the comparability of different approaches even within the two concept families is low at present, indicating the need for a comparative model evaluation for a proper assessment of the methods.},

Biocontrol strains were almost four times more effective in suppressing bacterial wilt in {IRAT} L3, a partially resistant tomato line, than in L390, a highly susceptible line. Pseudomonas brassicacearum 93D8 and Wood 1R, and P. fluorescens Clinto 1 were the most effective strains with biocontrol efficacy of 68, 47 and 56\% respectively, in {IRAT} L3. Bacterial wilt incidence was suppressed in {IRAT} L3 in four of four experiments by P. brassicacearum 93D8, and in three of four experiments by P. protegens Clinto 1 and P. brassicacearum Wood 1R. However, in L390, biocontrol efficacy of P. brassicacearum 93D8 and Wood 1R, and P. fluorescens Clinto 1 was 7, 15 and 12\%, respectively. There was no correlation between in vitro antagonism of the biocontrol strains against R. pseudosolanacearum and in vivo biocontrol efficacy.

Bacterial wilt dis­ ease, caused by soilborne bacteria in the Ralstonia solanacearum Species Complex (Ralstonia), results in significant crop loss throughout the world. Ralstonia invades root systems and colonizes plant xylem, changing plant physiology and ultimately causing plant wilting in susceptible varieties. Elucidating how Ralstonia invades and colonizes plants is central to developing strategies for crop protection. Here we review Ralstonia pathogenesis from root detection and attachment, early root colonization, xylem invasion and subsequent wilting. We focus primarily on studies in tomato from the last 5–10 years. Recent work has identified elegant mechanisms Ralstonia uses to adapt to the plant xylem, and has discovered new genes that function in Ralstonia fitness in planta. A picture is emerging of an amazingly versatile pathogen that uses multiple strategies to make its surrounding environment more hospitable and can adapt to new environments.},

	abstract = {A model for the turnover of organic matter in soil, {ROTHC}-26.3, can be used to calculate how much organic C needs to enter a soil annually in order to maintain a specified stock of soil organic C. The annual return of organic C thus calculated, plus the amount of organic C removed annually from the site by harvesting, burning, etc., provides an estimate of the Net Primary Production ({NPP}) of that site, averaged over many years. The new method was used to calculate {NPP} for two adjacent savanna sites in the Nairobi National Park in Kenya, one grazed and one not, and for a dry Miombo woodland site in Zambia. Both the Kenyan and Zambian sites are taken to be at equilibrium, with soil organic C levels at steady state. Soils from the three sites were analyzed by layer for organic C, δ14C, δ13C, soil microbial biomass C, total N, {pH}, and clay content. Radiocarbon measurements were {\textgreater}100\% modern in the surface layers (0–15 cm) of the Kenyan soils (both Vertisols) and in all three layers (0–15, 15–30 and 30–50 cm) of the Zambian soil (an Oxisol), presumably because of 14C coming from the testing of thermonuclear bombs. The 15–30 cm layer of the Kenyan soils dated at ∼500 yr and the 30–50 cm layer at ∼900 yr. The 14C data were consistent with the presence of a small inert fraction of organic C that accounted for an increasing proportion of total organic C with increasing soil depth. The 13C data indicated that the Kenyan soils had developed under C4 vegetation, whereas the Zambian soils had developed under vegetation dominated by C3 plants. From these results the annual input of C to soil from the ungrazed Kenyan site was calculated to be 388 g C·m−2·yr−1, to the grazed site 380 g C·m−2·yr−1, and to the Zambian soil 373 g C·m−2·yr−1. Taking the loss of C from the Kenyan sites by burning to be 40 g C·m−2·yr−1, the mean {NPP} for both Kenyan sites is 424 g C·m−2·yr−1. This value for {NPP} is compatible with earlier estimates of {NPP} by botanical methods from the same site in Kenya. Wood-taking is thought to be minimal in the protected Zambian woodland, so that here the annual input of C to the soil can be taken as the {NPP} without great error. This new method provides a long-term, integrated measure of {NPP} that should complement and enhance productivity measurements made by harvest methods over shorter periods.},

	abstract = {{ONE} effect of global warming will be to accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, thereby releasing {CO}2 to the atmosphere, which will further enhance the warming trend1–7. Such a feedback mechanism could be quantitatively important, because {CO}2 is thought to be responsible for ∼55\% of the increase in radiative forcing arising from anthropogenic emissions of gases to the atmosphere8, and there is about twice as much carbon in the top metre of soil as in the atmosphere9. Here we use the Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic matter in soil3 to calculate the amount of {CO}2 that would be released from the world stock of soil organic matter if temperatures increase as predicted, the annual return of plant debris to the soil being held constant. If world temperatures rise by 0.03 °C yr−1 (the increase considered as most likely by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change8), we estimate that the additional release of {CO}2 from soil organic matter over the next 60 years will be 61 × 1015 {gC}. This is ∼19\% of the {CO}2 that will be released by combustion of fossil fuel during the next 60 years if present use of fuel continues unabated.},

	abstract = {Using various plant materials, we identified two conceptual pools of plant litter, decomposable plant material ({DPM}) and resistant plant material ({RPM}), in the Rothamsted Carbon Model ({RothC}) by comparing the default proportions of {DPM} and {RPM} in the {RothC} and proportions in plant material fractions as determined by two-step acid hydrolysis with H2SO4. We collected 37 plant samples from 15 species at six sites on arable land, grassland, or forest in Japan. Carbon in the plant materials was divided into three pools by acid hydrolysis: (a) Labile Pool I ({LP} I), obtained by hydrolysis with 5N H2SO4 at 105°C for 30min; (b) Labile Pool {II} ({LP} {II}), obtained by hydrolysis with 26N H2SO4 at room temperature overnight, and then with 2N H2SO4 at 105°C for 3h; and (c) Recalcitrant Pool ({RP}), the unhydrolyzed residue. The average proportion of {LP} I in crops and grasses was 59\%, which was the same as the proportion of {DPM} defined in the {RothC} as the default value for crops and grasses. The remaining 41\% (23\% {LP} {II}+18\% {RP}) was consequently the same as the {RPM} proportion defined in the {RothC}. Similarly, the average proportion of {LP} I in all tree leaves (19\%) was very close to the proportion of {DPM} in the {RothC} (20\%) for trees. These results indicate that {DPM} in the {RothC} can be identified as {LP} I from the acid hydrolysis analysis and {RPM} as {LP} {II}+{RP}. We conclude that, at least theoretically, the use of an independent {DPM}:{RPM} ratio, as determined by acid hydrolysis analysis for each plant material, should enable more reliable modeling of {SOM} dynamics than the use of default {DPM}:{RPM} values provided by the model, even though the practical advantages of this method require further evaluation.},

Humification of {SOM} was evaluated in the soil and its fractions (clay{\textless}2μm, silt 2–20μm, sand 20–1000μm). The obtained results show that lower {SOM} humification was observed in soil under {NT}, mainly at the surface (0–5cm). In {CT}, {SOM} humification values maintained constant for all investigated depths (0–5, 5–10, 10–15 and 15–20cm). Also, clay was the soil fraction that exhibited the lesser humification of {SOM}. Based on the obtained results it can be said that {NT} favors the accumulation of {SOM} on its surface, increasing aggregate stability and presenting samples with lower humification indexes. These results indicate a larger availability of nutrients for the plants in this management.},

Our objective was to study the effect of drought on C allocation and rhizosphere-mediated {CO}2 fluxes under three plant species: Lolium perenne, Festuca arundinacea and Medicago sativa grown in monocultures or mixture. The conceptual approach included 14CO2 pulse labeling of plants grown under drought and optimum water conditions in order to be able to follow above- and belowground C allocation. After 14C pulse labeling, we traced 14C allocation to shoots and roots, soil and rhizospheric {CO}2, dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) and microbial biomass. Drought and plant community composition significantly affected assimilate allocation in the plant-soil system. Drought conditions changed the source sink relationship of monocultures, which transferred a relatively larger portion of assimilates to their roots compared to water sufficient plants. In contrast, plant mixture showed an increase in 14C allocation to shoots when exposed to drought. Under drought stress, root respiration was reduced for all monocultures except under the legume species. Microbial respiration remained similar in all cases showing that microbial activity was less affected by drought than root activity. This may be explained by strongly increased assimilate allocation to easily available exudates or rhizodeposits under drought. In conclusion, plant community composition may modify the impact of climatic changes on carbon allocation and belowground carbon fluxes. The presence of legume species attenuates drought effects on rhizosphere processes.},

	abstract = {It is still unclear whether elevated {CO}2 increases plant root exudation and consequently affects the soil microbial biomass. The effects of elevated {CO}2 on the fate of the C and nitrogen (N) contained in old soil organic matter pools is also unclear. In this study the short and long-term effects of elevated {CO}2 on C and N pools and fluxes were assessed by growing isolated plants of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in glasshouses at elevated and ambient atmospheric {CO}2 and using soil from the New Zealand {FACE} site that had {\textgreater}4 years exposure to {CO}2 enrichment. Using 14CO2 pulse labelling, the effects of elevated {CO}2 on C allocation within the plant-soil system were studied. Under elevated {CO}2 more root derived C was found in the soil and in the microbial biomass 48h after labelling. The increased availability of substrate significantly stimulated soil microbial growth and acted as priming effect, enhancing native soil organic matter decomposition regardless of the mineral N supply. Despite indications of faster N cycling in soil under elevated {CO}2, N availability to plants stayed unchanged. Soil previously exposed to elevated {CO}2 exhibited a higher N cycling rate but again there was no effect on plant N uptake. With respect to the difficulties of extrapolating glasshouse experiment results to the field, we concluded that the accumulation of coarse organic matter observed in the field under elevated {CO}2 was probably not created by an imbalance between C and N but was likely to be due to more complex phenomena involving soil mesofauna and/or other nutrients limitations.},

	abstract = {Four crop rotation and management systems were studied in 1994 and 1995 in relation to growth and yield of irrigated processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). The four treatments were three four-year rotation systems [conventional (conv-4), low input and organic] and a two-year rotation system [conventional (conv-2)]. The four-year rotation was tomato-safflower-corn-wheat(or oats+vetch)/beans, and the two-year rotation was tomato-wheat. Purple vetch (Vicia sativa L.) was grown as a green manure cover crop preceeding tomatoes in the low input and organic systems. Nitrogen was supplied as fertilizer in the conventional systems, as vetch green manure plus fertilizer in the low input system and as vetch green manure plus turkey manure in the organic system. Tomato cv. Brigade was direct-seeded in the conventional systems and transplanted to the field in the low input and organic systems. In both years the winter cover crop was composed of a mixture of vetch and volunteer oats with N contents of 2.2\% in 1994 and 2.7\% (low input) or 1.8\% (organic) in 1995. In 1994 yields were higher in conventionally grown tomatoes because a virus in the nursery infected the transplants used in the low input and organic systems. In 1995 tomatoes grown with the low input and conv-4 systems had similar yields, which were higher than those of tomatoes grown with the conv-2 and organic systems. N uptake by the crop was greater than 200 kg N ha−1 for high yield ({\textgreater} 75 t ha−1) and uptake rates of 3 to 6 kg N ha−1 day−1 during the period of maximum uptake were observed. The lower yield with the organic system in 1995 was caused by a N deficiency. The main effect of the N deficiency was a reduced leaf area index and not a reduction of net assimilation rate ({NAR}) or radiation use efficiency ({RUE}). Nitrogen deficiency was related to low concentration of inorganic N in the soil and slow release of N from the cover crop + manure. A high proportion of N from the green manure but only a low proportion of N from the manure was mineralized during the crop season. In the conventional systems, the estimated mineralized N from the soil organic matter during the crop season was around 85 kg ha−1. A hyperbolic relationship between N content and total dry weight of aboveground biomass was observed in procesing tomatoes with adequate N nutrition. Lower yields with the conv-2 than with the conv-4 system were due to higher incidence of diseases in the two year rotation which reduced the {NAR} and the {RUE}. Residual N in the soil in Oct. (two months after the incorporation of crop residues) ranged between 90 and 170 kg N ha−1 in the 0–90 cm profile.},

Yield was greater with {CP} and {MP} than with {NT} in 1996 and was greater with 90 and 180 than with 0 kg·ha-1 N in 1996 and 1997. Similarly, aboveground tomato biomass (dry weight of stems + leaves + fruits) and N uptake were greater with {CP} and {MP} than with {NT} from 40 to 118 days after transplanting ({DAT}) in 1996; greater with hairy vetch than with winter weeds at 82 {DAT} in 1997; and greater with 90 or 180 than with 0 kg·ha-1 N at 97 {DAT} in 1996 and at 82 {DAT} in 1997. Soil inorganic N was greater with {NT} or {CP} than with {MP} at 0- to 10-cm depth at 0 and 30 {DAT} in 1996; greater with hairy vetch than with winter weeds at 0- to 10-cm and at 10- to 30-cm at 0 {DAT} in 1996 and 1997, respectively; and greater with 90 or 180 than with 0 kg·ha-1 N from 30 to 116 {DAT} in 1996 and 1997. Levels of soil inorganic N and tomato N uptake indicated that N release from cover crop residues was synchronized with N need by tomato, and that N fertilization should be done within 8 weeks of transplanting. Similar tomato yield, biomass, and N uptake with {CP} vs. {MP} and with 90 vs. 180 kg·ha-1 N suggests that minimum tillage, such as {CP}, and 90 kg·ha-1 N can better sustain tomato yield and reduce potentials for soil erosion and N leaching than can conventional tillage, such as {MP}, and 180 kg·ha-1 N, respectively. Because of increased vegetative cover in the winter, followed by increased mulch and soil N in the summer, hairy vetch can reduce the potential for soil erosion and the amount of N fertilization required for tomato better than can winter weeds.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric C sequestration in agricultural soils is viewed as one of the most promising negative emission technologies currently available. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how strongly soil organic carbon ({SOC}) stocks respond to agricultural practices, especially for subsoil. Here, we assess the {SOC} storage potential in croplands and how the presence of temporary grasslands ({TG}) in the crop rotation affects {SOC} stocks. We developed a new approach to correct for bias in bulk density ({BD}) induced by sampling conditions and land-use effects with a data-driven model to predict the {BD} of fine soil ({\textless}2 mm) for reference condition. Using 54 permanent grassland and cropland sites with various proportions of {TG} from a monitoring network in Switzerland, we showed that {SOC} stock differences down to 50-cm depth between cropland and permanent grasslands (maximum: 3.0 ± 0.8 kg C m−2) depend on the {TG} proportion in the crop rotation, regardless of clay content and {pH}. An increase of the {TG} proportion by 10\% would induce a {SOC} gain of 0.40 ± 0.13 kg C m−2. The responses of topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (20–50 cm) {SOC} stocks to {TG} proportion were linear and equivalent. The effect of {TG} on {SOC} storage would have been underestimated by 58\% without accounting for subsoil stocks response and by 16\% without {BD} corrections. The conversion of all croplands to permanent grasslands in the study region would potentially store a quantity of {SOC} equivalent to the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions generated by the same region during one year. Although the potential of agricultural soils as negative emission technology is relatively modest compared to former expectations, the findings demonstrate the potential to manage {SOC} and its associated ecosystem services at large scales and down to deep soil layers.},

	abstract = {Despite its fundamental role for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, rhizodeposition remains ‘the hidden half of the hidden half’: it is highly dynamic and rhizodeposits are rapidly incorporated into microorganisms, soil organic matter, and decomposed to {CO}2. Therefore, rhizodeposition is rarely quantified and remains the most uncertain part of the soil C cycle and of C fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. This review synthesizes and generalizes the literature on C inputs by rhizodeposition under crops and grasslands (281 data sets). The allocation dynamics of assimilated C (after 13C-{CO}2 or 14C-{CO}2 labeling of plants) were quantified within shoots, shoot respiration, roots, net rhizodeposition (i.e., C remaining in soil for longer periods), root-derived {CO}2, and microorganisms. Partitioning of C pools and fluxes were used to extrapolate belowground C inputs via rhizodeposition to ecosystem level. Allocation from shoots to roots reaches a maximum within the first day after C assimilation. Annual crops retained more C (45\% of assimilated 13C or 14C) in shoots than grasses (34\%), mainly perennials, and allocated 1.5 times less C belowground. For crops, belowground C allocation was maximal during the first 1–2 months of growth and decreased very fast thereafter. For grasses, it peaked after 2–4 months and remained very high within the second year causing much longer allocation periods. Despite higher belowground C allocation by grasses (33\%) than crops (21\%), its distribution between various belowground pools remains very similar. Hence, the total C allocated belowground depends on the plant species, but its further fate is species independent. This review demonstrates that C partitioning can be used in various approaches, e.g., root sampling, {CO}2 flux measurements, to assess rhizodeposits’ pools and fluxes at pot, plot, field and ecosystem scale and so, to close the most uncertain gap of the terrestrial C cycle.},

	abstract = {The soil organic matter plays a key role in ecological soil functions, and has to be considered as an important {CO}2 sink on a global scale. Apart from crop residues (shoots and roots), left over on the field after harvest, carbon and nitrogen compounds are also released by plant roots into the soil during vegetation, and undergo several transformation processes. Up to now the knowledge about amount, composition, and turnover of these root-borne compounds is still very limited. So far it could be demonstrated with different plant species, that up to 20 \% of photosynthetically fixed C are released into the soil during vegetation period. These C amounts are ecological relevant. Depending on assimilate sink strength during ontogenesis, the C release varies with plant age. A large percentage of these root-borne substances were rapidly respired by microorganisms (64—86 \%). About 2—5 \% of net C assimilation was kept in soil. The root exudates of maize were mainly water-soluble (79 \%), and in this fraction about 64 \% carbohydrates, 22 \% amino acids/amides and 14 \% organic acids could be identified. Plant species and in some cases also plant cultivars varied strongly in their root exudation pattern. Under non-sterile conditions the exuded compounds were rapidly stabilized in water-insoluble forms and bound preferably to the soil clay fraction. The binding of root exudates to soil particles also improved soil structure by increasing aggregate stability. Future research should focus on quantification and characterization of root-borne C compounds during the whole plant ontogenesis. Apart from pot experiments with 14CO2 labeling, it is necessary to conduct model field experiments with 13CO2 labeling in order to be able to distinguish between {CO}2 originating from the soil C pool and rhizosphere respiration, originating from plant assimilates. Such a separation is necessary to assess if soils are sources or sinks of {CO}2. The incorporation of root-borne C (14C, 13C) into soil organic matter of different stability is also of particular interest.},

	abstract = {The loss of organic and inorganic carbon from roots into soil underpins nearly all the major changes that occur in the rhizosphere. In this review we explore the mechanistic basis of organic carbon and nitrogen flow in the rhizosphere. It is clear that C and N flow in the rhizosphere is extremely complex, being highly plant and environment dependent and varying both spatially and temporally along the root. Consequently, the amount and type of rhizodeposits (e.g. exudates, border cells, mucilage) remains highly context specific. This has severely limited our capacity to quantify and model the amount of rhizodeposition in ecosystem processes such as C sequestration and nutrient acquisition. It is now evident that C and N flow at the soil–root interface is bidirectional with C and N being lost from roots and taken up from the soil simultaneously. Here we present four alternative hypotheses to explain why high and low molecular weight organic compounds are actively cycled in the rhizosphere. These include: (1) indirect, fortuitous root exudate recapture as part of the root’s C and N distribution network, (2) direct re-uptake to enhance the plant’s C efficiency and to reduce rhizosphere microbial growth and pathogen attack, (3) direct uptake to recapture organic nutrients released from soil organic matter, and (4) for inter-root and root–microbial signal exchange. Due to severe flaws in the interpretation of commonly used isotopic labelling techniques, there is still great uncertainty surrounding the importance of these individual fluxes in the rhizosphere. Due to the importance of rhizodeposition in regulating ecosystem functioning, it is critical that future research focuses on resolving the quantitative importance of the different C and N fluxes operating in the rhizosphere and the ways in which these vary spatially and temporally.},

	abstract = {The link between carbon turnover model pools and measurable carbon fractions is of key interest for initial parameterisation and subsequent validation of dynamic soil carbon models. In this study we performed the established particle-size fractionation of soils from 54 intensively monitored sites in Germany and from archived samples from 5 other long-term experiments in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Rothamsted carbon ({RothC}) model was then used to compare the measured soil C fractionation from the 54 intensively monitored sites against modelled pools using spin-up equilibrium runs whilst dynamic (non-equilibrium) model runs were performed when comparing data from the long-term experiments. We detected good agreement between measured soil C fractions and modelled pools, indicated by correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.81 for the resistant plant material pool ({RPM}) and 0.91 and 0.94 for the humus pool ({HUM}) for the intensively monitored and the long-term sites, respectively. Slightly larger errors were detected for the intensively monitored sites together with a bias in the relationship between the {RPM} pool and particulate organic matter fraction. This bias detected for the intensively monitored sites indicated that the equilibrium assumption for arable agricultural sites, even though under crop cover for at least 50years, might not be entirely valid. From the relative mean absolute error of 11\% for the {HUM} pool and 26\% for the {RPM} pool of the combined data set we conform that the measured fractions can be used to estimate the {RothC} model pools in arable soils. Given the magnitude of these errors, however, we rather suggest to apply the fractionation approach instead of using an equilibrium assumption for the {RothC} initialisation of arable sites.},

It indicates how efficiently biomass can be transformed into {SOC}, which is of particular relevance for mitigating climate change by means of {SOC} storage. There have been few comprehensive studies of {MRTOC} and their drivers, and these have mainly been restricted to the global scale, on which climatic drivers dominate. This study used the unique combination of regional-scale cropland and grassland topsoil (0–30 cm) {SOC} stock data and average site-specific {OC} input data derived from the German Agricultural Soil Inventory to elucidate the main drivers of {MRTOC}. Explanatory variables related to {OC} input composition and other soil-forming factors were used to explain the variability in {MRTOC} by means of a machine-learning approach. On average, {OC} entering German agricultural topsoils had an {MRT} of 21.5 ± 11.6 years, with grasslands (29.0 ± 11.2 years, n = 465) having significantly higher {MRTOC} than croplands (19.4 ± 10.7, n = 1635). This was explained by the higher proportion of root-derived {OC} inputs in grassland soils, which was the most important variable for explaining {MRTOC} variability at a regional scale. Soil properties such as clay content, soil group, C:N ratio and groundwater level were also important, indicating that {MRTOC} is driven by a combination of site properties and {OC} input composition. However, the great importance of root-derived {OC} inputs indicated that {MRTOC} can be actively managed, with maximization of root biomass input to the soil being a straightforward means to extend the time that assimilated C remains in the soil and consequently also increase {SOC} stocks.},

However different types of C-sources can have different behaviour, in relation to their chemical characteristics and how they interact with soil. Root-derived C, in particular, should be more efficient than other organic materials as a result of the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the surrounding environment, leading to a reduction in the C decomposition rate. To test this hypothesis, we considered a long-term experiment underway in Northern Italy since 1962, comparing permanent meadow and 6 different crop rotations over a wide range of nutrient inputs, in both organic and inorganic forms. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop and residues yields. The time evolution of {SOC} was studied through a single-pool, first-order kinetic model, allowing the estimation of humification coefficients for residues, roots, farmyard manure and cattle slurries. The highest value of the humification coefficient was estimated for farmyard manure, which confirmed its high efficiency in stabilising {SOC} content. Root C presented a humification coefficient 1.9 times higher than above-ground plant materials while slurries were intermediate, with a humification coefficient roughly half that of farmyard manure and even lower that of roots. The quality of C input thus seems of fundamental importance for evaluating the sustainability of different cropping systems in terms of {SOC} dynamics.},

	abstract = {Afforestation of grassland has been globally identified as being an important means for creating a sink for atmospheric carbon (C). However, the impact of afforestation on soil C is still poorly understood, due to the paucity of well designed long-term experiments and the lack of investigation into the response of different soil C fractions to afforestation. In addition, little is known about the origins of soil C and soil organic matter ({SOM}) stability after afforestation. In a retrospective study, we measured C mass in the soil light and heavy fractions in the first 10 years after afforestation of grassland with Eucalyptus nitens, Pinus radiata and Cupressus macrocarpa. The results suggest that C mass in the soil heavy fraction remained stable, but the C mass in the light fraction decreased at year 5 under three species. Soil δ13C analysis showed that the decrease in the light fraction may be due to reduced C inputs from grassland species litter and low inputs from the still young trees. After the initial reduction, the recovery of soil C in the light fraction depended on tree species. At year 10, an increase of 33\% in light fraction soil C was observed at the 0–30 cm depth under E. nitens, compared to that under the original grassland (year 0). Planting P. radiata restored light fraction soil C to the original level under grassland, whereas planting C. macrocarpa led to a decrease of 33\%. We concluded that the increase of light fraction soil C between year 5 and 10 is most likely due to C input from tree residues. Most of the increased C was derived from root turnover under pine and from both root and leaf turnover under E. nitens, as indicated by plant C biomarkers such as lignin-derived phenols and suberin and cutin-derived compounds in the 0–5 cm soil layer. Modelling of soil ∆14C‰ suggested that {SOM} had a greater mean residence time at year 10 than year 0 and 5 due to increased relative abundance of recalcitrant plant biopolymers.},

The number of root intersections of Brussels sprouts, wheat and potato declined with depth at any time, whereas leek showed a different pattern because maximum root growth was observed at a depth of 10-20 cm. Root density generally decreased in the following order: Brussels sprouts, wheat, potato and leek. Plots of root length densities, Lrv(cm. cm⁻³), obtained by auger sampling, versus the number of intersections showed considerable variation in slope with species, time in the season and year, implying that a single, universal equation to convert minirhizotron observations into volumetric root densities does not exist.

For many organic fertilizers, the database concerning all these characteristics is weak. Therefore, in the frame of collections carried out throughout Germany, 77 samples of commercial organic fertilizers were analyzed for their nutrient and pollutant contents. Commercial organic fertilizers differ widely in nutrient concentration as well as in nutrient spectrum, meaning large differences among the fertilizers in their suitability to complement the nutrient supply by base organic fertilizers like composts, livestock manures, or digestates. The sampled commercial organic fertilizers show stable values for few characteristics (e.g. concentration of organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen), and high variation in the composition of the most other macro- and micronutrients as well as toxic metals. Consequently, the use of default values in budget calculation sheets can result in considerable errors of estimation. The concentrations of toxic elements, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants are low, indicating the low risk of pollution related to their use.},

Danke, mir geht es gut. Ich hoffe dir auch!

Zu deinen Fragen:
1.	Im Fall von Gemüse gibt es leider nur eine Durchschnittskultur. Falls ihr jedoch Daten habt um spezifische Kulturen zu definieren, wäre es gut möglich das Skript um eine beliebige Anzahl anzupassen und ich würde euch gerne dabei unterstützen. Man müsste die Erträge haben und die Menge der Ernterückstände. Idealerweise wären die Ernterückstände noch in ober- und unterirische Rückstände aufgeteilt. Für die Modellierung spielt das jedoch nicht eine grosse Rolle. Das Wichtigste wäre nur der Anteil der Ernterückstände im Vergleich zum Ertrag. Als Beispiel: Kohl: 20\% (der gesamten Biomasse) Ernterückstände (ergänzend noch: X\% Wurzeln und X\% Wurzelexsudate). Das könnten auch Schätzungen von Experten sein 😊. 
2.	Ja der initiale {SOC} ist in t C/ha angegeben und bezieht sich im Moment auf 0-30 cm (die Tiefe kann jedoch angepasst werden). 
3.	Temperaturen, ja das sind Lufttemperaturen auf 2m.

	abstract = {The Rothamsted Carbon ({RothC}) model, which is one of widely used soil carbon (C) models, was validated against long-term experimental datasets in Japan and modified to suit Andosols and paddy soils reflecting unique soil C turnover mechanisms in these soils. Nationwide soil C calculation system was developed by combining these modified models and spatial model input data such as weather, soil type, land use, and agricultural activities. The model was validated in China and Thailand by using long-term field experimental datasets, too. Further studies especially in tropical Asia will be needed. Matching conceptual model C pools with measurable fractions have been big challenges. Using various plant materials, two conceptual pools of plant litter, decomposable plant material ({DPM}) and resistant plant material ({RPM}), in the {RothC} were successfully identified. It was achieved by comparing the default proportions of {DPM} and {RPM} pools in the {RothC} and proportions in plant material fractions determined by two-step acid hydrolysis with H2SO4. The trial to match all of five C pools in the model, however, remains unachieved though a study was conducted comparing not only the size of C pools but mean residence time of the pools. A web-based decision support tool called ‘Visualization of {CO}2 absorption by soils’ was developed. This allows users to easily calculate changes in soil C, {CH}4 and N2O emissions, and fossil fuel consumption. With this tool, farmers can see how to improve the environmental sustainability of their products and this tool may help spread mitigation options widely. Soil C sequestration can help achieve climate change mitigation and sustainable agricultural production. Importance of long-term field observations should be more highlighted because long-term experiments have supported the development of modeling approaches. I hope models will be more widely used by decision makers. Collaboration between modeling and monitoring studies is important.},

It indicates how efficiently biomass can be transformed into {SOC}, which is of particular relevance for mitigating climate change by means of {SOC} storage. There have been few comprehensive studies of {MRTOC} and their drivers, and these have mainly been restricted to the global scale, on which climatic drivers dominate. This study used the unique combination of regional-scale cropland and grassland topsoil (0–30 cm) {SOC} stock data and average site-specific {OC} input data derived from the German Agricultural Soil Inventory to elucidate the main drivers of {MRTOC}. Explanatory variables related to {OC} input composition and other soil-forming factors were used to explain the variability in {MRTOC} by means of a machine-learning approach. On average, {OC} entering German agricultural topsoils had an {MRT} of 21.5 ± 11.6 years, with grasslands (29.0 ± 11.2 years, n = 465) having significantly higher {MRTOC} than croplands (19.4 ± 10.7, n = 1635). This was explained by the higher proportion of root-derived {OC} inputs in grassland soils, which was the most important variable for explaining {MRTOC} variability at a regional scale. Soil properties such as clay content, soil group, C:N ratio and groundwater level were also important, indicating that {MRTOC} is driven by a combination of site properties and {OC} input composition. However, the great importance of root-derived {OC} inputs indicated that {MRTOC} can be actively managed, with maximization of root biomass input to the soil being a straightforward means to extend the time that assimilated C remains in the soil and consequently also increase {SOC} stocks.},

However, estimating the potential change in national soil carbon stocks following adoption of {RA} practices is required to determine its suitability for this. Here, we use a well-validated model of soil carbon turnover ({RothC}) to simulate adoption of three regenerative practices (cover cropping, reduced tillage intensity and incorporation of a grass-based ley phase into arable rotations) across arable land in Great Britain ({GB}). We develop a modelling framework which calibrates {RothC} using studies of these measures from a recent systematic review, estimating the proportional increase in carbon inputs to the soil compared to conventional practice, before simulating adoption across {GB}. We find that cover cropping would on average increase {SOC} stocks by 10 t·ha−1 within 30 years of adoption across {GB}, potentially sequestering 6.5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year ({MtCO}2·y−1). Ley-arable systems could increase {SOC} stocks by 3 or 16 t·ha−1, potentially providing 2.2 or 10.6 {MtCO}2·y−1 of sequestration over 30 years, depending on the length of the ley-phase (one and four years, respectively, in these scenarios). In contrast, our modelling approach finds little change in soil carbon stocks when practising reduced tillage intensity. Our results indicate that adopting {RA} practices could make a meaningful contribution to {GB} agriculture reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions despite practical constraints to their uptake.},

	abstract = {The organic carbon mineralization process reflects the release intensity of soil {CO}2. Therefore, the study of organic carbon mineralization and particle composition analysis of soft rock and sand compound soil can provide technical support and a theoretical basis for soil organic reconstruction (soil structure, materials and biological nutrition). Based on previous research, four treatments were selected: {CK} (soft rock:sand=0:1), C1 (soft rock:sand=1:5), C2 (soft rock:sand=1:2) and C3 (soft rock:sand=1:1), respectively. Specifically, we analyzed the organic carbon mineralization process and soil particle composition by lye absorption, laser granulometer, and scanning electron microscope. The results showed that there was no significant difference in organic carbon content between C1, C2 , and C3 treatments, but they were significantly higher than in the {CK} treatment (P {\textless} 0.05). The organic carbon mineralization rate in each treatment accords with a logarithmic function throughout the incubation period (P {\textless} 0.01), which can be divided into a rapid decline phase in days 1 to 11 followed by a steady decline phase in days 11 to 30. The cumulative mineralization on the 11th day reached 54.96\%–74.44\% of the total mineralization amount. At the end of the incubation, the cumulative mineralization and potential mineralizable organic carbon content of the C1, C2 and C3 treatments were significantly higher than those of the {CK} treatment. The cumulative mineralization rate was also the lowest in the C1 and C2 treatment. The turnover rate constant of soil organic carbon in each treatment was significantly lower than that of the {CK} treatment, and the residence time increased. With the increase of volume fraction of soft rock, the content of silt and clay particles increased gradually, the texture of soil changed from sandy soil to sandy loam, loam , and silty loam, respectively. With the increase of small particles, the structure of soil appear ed to collapse when the volume ratio of soft rock was 50\%. A comprehensive mineralization index and scanning electron microscopy analysis, when the ratio of soft rock to sand volume was 1:5–1:2, this can effectively increase the accumulation of soil organic carbon. Then, the distribution of soil particles was more uniform, the soil structure was stable (not collapsed), and the mineralization level of unit organic carbon was lower. Our research results have practical significance for the large area popularization of soft rock and sand compound technology.},

	abstract = {Hello Peter, 
Sorry for a late reply. We based the relation on known humification coefficients for straw, compost and farmyard manure next to reported {DPM}/{RPM} ratios. With only 3 values this relation between {DPM}/{RPM} and hc is not robust - we also never attempted to publish anything on this but just used it to 'translate' known hc's for crops in Belgium to a farmer advisory system (quite practical but not very robust - I cannot provide you with a real reference). Meanwhile we have abandoned this avenue - I would no longer refer to our 2009 study. 
We now calculate {DPM}/{RPM} ratios using the approach by Thünen Institute (René Dechow: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.001): i.e. root biomass and aboveground biomass for all crops have fixed hc's (0.26 for shoots and 0.47 for roots + rhizodeposition) and the average hc of crop residues is thus entirely dependent on the root-to-shoot ratio. For conversion into {DPM}/{RPMs}: shoot biomass is entirely {DPM}, roots are composed for 86\% of {RPM} and 14\% {DPM}. 
In fact Peter Maenhout from {ILVO} in cc (Institute for agriculture and fisheries research - from the Flemish government) has looked into humification coefficients for a range of crops and compared different sources for this - maybe you'll want to talk to him about this as well.

	abstract = {Below ground carbon ({BGC}) inputs to soil, i.e. root biomass and rhizodeposition carbon (C), are among the most important variables driving soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Hence, increasing {BGC} inputs to deep soil is a proposed strategy to sequester C in the long term. As {BGC} inputs are inherently difficult to measure in the field, they are usually estimated from yield in order to supply soil C models with input data. While fertilization intensity considerably affects above ground biomass, its influence on {BGC} inputs is largely unclear, especially with respect to the subsoil. Therefore, we determined net root biomass and rhizodeposition C of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest in different farming systems (bio-organic, conventional) and fertilization treatments (zero, manure, mineral) along an intensity gradient in two Swiss long-term field trials. Plants in microplots were repeatedly pulse-labelled with 13C-{CO}2 throughout the growing seasons and shoots, roots, and soil to 0.75 m depth were sampled at harvest. Despite a strong increase of above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity, {BGC} inputs were similar among treatments on both sites irrespective of soil depth. However, the proportions of rhizodeposition C of {BGC} inputs averaged 54 to 63\% and were, therefore, much larger than the widely adopted 40\% for field-grown cereals. They increased with soil depth and were highest under sole organic fertilization. The shift in whole-plant C allocation towards above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity entailed 10\% higher C allocation below ground in organic than conventional farming for both maize and wheat. Our findings imply that yield-independent values provide closer estimates for {BGC} inputs to soil of cereals in different farming systems than yield-based functions. We further conclude that fertilization has only little potential to alter absolute amounts of {BGC} inputs to deep soil in order to sequester C in the long term.},

However, rigorous routines for establishing entry pools that account for the diversity of exogenous organic matter ({EOM}) applied to croplands are still lacking. We obtained data on changes in soil C stocks after repeated applications of {EOM} from four long-term experiments ({LTEs}): Askov K2 (Denmark, 31 yrs), Qualiagro (France, 11 yrs), {SERAIL} (France, 14 yrs) and Ultuna (Sweden, 52 yrs). The adjustment of the partition coefficients of total organic C in {EOM} ({EOM}-{TOC}) into the labile, resistant and humified entry pools of {RothC} ({fDPM}, {fRPM}, {fHUM}, respectively) provided a successful fit to the accumulation of {EOM}-derived C in the {LTE} soils. Equations estimating the {EOM} partition coefficients in the {RothC} model were based on an indicator ({IROC}) of the {EOM}-{TOC} potentially retained in soil. {IROC} was derived from the C found in the soluble, lignin + cutin-like and cellulose-like Van Soest fractions and the proportion of {EOM}-{TOC} mineralized during 3 days of incubation. Using the {EOM} partition coefficients derived from these laboratory analyses resulted in {RothC} simulations with only slightly larger errors than simulations based on partition coefficients fitted from {LTE} soil data, except for {EOMs} that caused very large accumulations of C in soil (e.g. peat) possibly due to factors not accounted for in the {RothC} model, such as change in soil {pH}. The proposed partitioning of {EOM}-{TOC} allows the potential soil C storage after {EOM} applications to be predicted regardless of field location and specific composition of {EOMs}.},

	abstract = {Models are important for predicting how soil organic carbon alters with changing environment and management. We tested three different ways of parameterizing the Rothamsted Carbon Model in four treatments from the long-term static fertilization experiment at Bad Lauchstädt. Four bare fallow plots were also used to test different ways of parameterizing the model. Model version 1 used Δ14C to estimate the amount of inert organic matter whereas in versions 2 and 3 a long-term bare fallow treatment was used to estimate this amount. In version 1, C inputs were optimized from the long-term data. In version 2, crop inputs were estimated from published functions that relate C inputs to crop yields. In version 3, C inputs (average or minimum data) were taken from actual measurements of crop and root residues. In both versions 2 and 3, rhizodeposition was included as additional input of 50\% (winter wheat, spring barley) or 35\% (potatoes, sugar beet) of the C input by crop and root residues. The performance of the three versions decreased in the order 3 {\textgreater} 2 ≫ 1. Model efficiency and root mean square error were 0.86 and 6.1 for version 3 and 0.81 and 7.0 for version 2. Overall, our results indicate the need for a long-term treatment for calibration. Setting total C inputs as a function of crop yield performed satisfactorily. Measurements of crop and root residues gave a good representation of total C inputs when carbon from rhizodeposition was included as additional input.},

Understanding the amount and distribution of this material in the soil profile could provide insight into resistance to soil erosion by water and improve the performance of soil erosion models, such as the revised universal soil loss equation ({RUSLE}) and the water erosion prediction project ({WEPP}). Erosion models use built-in or external crop growth models to populate crop yield and live aboveground and associated belowground biomass databases. We examined two data sets from the dryland small grain production region in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to determine root:shoot ratios, the vertical distribution of root and attached belowground biomass, and incorporated residue from previously grown crops. Data were collected in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 2000 from short-term no-till and conventional tillage experiments conducted near Pendleton, Oregon, and Pullman, Washington, and in 1999 and 2000 from long-term experiments representative of farming practices near Pendleton, Oregon. The crops sampled in the short-term data set included soft white winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; {WW} and {SW}, respectively), spring peas (Pisum sativum L.; {SP}), and winter canola (Brassica napus L.; {WC}). Crops sampled in the long-term study included {WW}, {SW}, and {SP}. Data were collected at harvest in both data sets and during three phenologic stages in each of the crops in the short-term data set. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 60 cm (23.6 in) in the short-term and 30 cm (11.9 in) in the long-term experiments. In both sets of measurements, we found greater than 70\% of root mass is in the top 10 cm (3.9 in) of the soil profile with the exception of {SP}, which had 70\% of root mass in the top 15 cm (5.9 in) of the soil profile. {WC} produced significantly more biomass near the soil surface than {WW}, {SW}, or {SP}. Root-to-shoot biomass ratios in mature wheat ranged from 0.13 to 0.17 in the top 30 cm (11.9 in) of the soil profile, substantially lower than values suggested for use in {WEPP} (0.25). In the long-term experiments, soil of the conventionally tilled continuous winter wheat ({CWW}) plots contained significantly greater biomass than soil of conventionally tilled winter wheat/fallow ({CR}) and no-till winter wheat/fallow ({NT}) treatments. There was no significant difference between {CWW} and conventionally tilled winter wheat/spring pea ({WP}); however, {CWW} returned more residue to the soil than {WP} because {SP} produced less residue and these residues were incorporated with a field cultivator rather than a moldboard plow. More accurate representation of root development, particularly in winter crops, could improve {RUSLE} and {WEPP} performance in the Pacific Northwest where winter conditions have proven difficult to model.},

	abstract = {To improve C sequestration in no-till soils requires further development of crop rotations with high phytomass-C additions. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess long-term (17 years) contributions of cover crop- or forage-based no-till rotations and their related shoot and root additions to the accumulation of C in bulk and in physical fractions of a subtropical Ferralsol (20-cm depth); and (ii) infer if these rotations promote C sequestration and reach an eventual C saturation level in the soil. A wheat (Triticum aestivum L., winter crop)–soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr, summer crop) succession was the baseline system. The soil under alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., hay forage) intercropped every three years with maize (Zea mays L., summer crop) had the highest C accumulation (0.44MgCha−1year−1). The bi-annual rotation of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., hay winter forage)–maize–ryegrass–soybean had a soil C sequestration of 0.32MgCha−1year−1. Among the two bi-annual cover crop-based rotations, the vetch (Vicia villosa Roth, winter cover crop)–maize–wheat–soybean rotation added 7.58MgCha−1year−1 as shoot plus root and sequestered 0.28MgCha−1year−1. The counterpart grass-based rotation of oat (Avena strigosa Schreb., winter cover crop)–maize–wheat–soybean sequestered only 0.16MgCha−1year−1, although adding 13\% more C (8.56Mgha−1year−1). The vetch legume-based rotation, with a relative conversion factor ({RCF}) of 0.147, was more efficient in converting biomass C into sequestered soil C than oat grass-based rotation ({RCF}=0.057). Soil C stocks showed a close relationship (R2=0.72–0.98, P{\textless}0.10) with root C addition, a poor relationship with total C addition and no relationship with shoot C addition. This suggests a more effective role of root than shoot additions in C accumulation in this no-till soil. Most of the C accumulation took place in the mineral-associated organic matter (71–95\%, in the 0–5cm layer) compared to the particulate organic matter. The asymptotic relationship between root C addition and C stocks in bulk soil and in mineral-associated fraction supports the idea of C saturation. In conclusion, forages or legume cover crops contribute to C sequestration in no-till tropical Ferrasols, and most of this contribution is from roots and stored in the mineral-associated fraction. This combination of soil and rotations can reach an eventual soil C saturation.},

The shoot and root growth, root characteristics, and mineral content of two lettuce cultivars were measured in aeroponics, and compared with hydroponics and substrate culture. The results showed that aeroponics remarkably improved root growth with a significantly greater root biomass, root/shoot ratio, and greater total root length, root area, and root volume. However, the greater root growth did not lead to greater shoot growth compared with hydroponics, due to the limited availability of nutrients and water. It was concluded that aeroponics systems may be better for high value true root crop production. Further research is necessary to determine the suitable pressure, droplet size, and misting interval in order to improve the continuous availability of nutrients and water in aeroponics, if it is to be used to grow crops such as lettuce for harvesting above-ground parts.},

Slower growing cabbage seedlings in compacted plots were more subject to flea beetle damage than the uncompacted controls. Prolonged flooding after heavy rainfall events in compacted areas had a more adverse effect on cabbage and snap bean than on cucumber or sweet corn. Sweet corn showed almost no growth reduction in one of the three years (1993) when relatively high fertilizer rates were applied and leaf nitrogen deficiencies in compacted plots were prevented. Maturity of cabbage, snap bean, and cucumber was delayed, and the average reduction in total marketable yield in (direct-seeded) compacted plots was 73\%, 49\%, 41\%, and 34\% for cabbage, snap bean, cucumber and sweet corn, respectively. Yield reduction in transplanted cabbage (evaluated in 1993 only) was 29\%. In a controlled environment greenhouse experiment using the same soil type and similar compaction treatment as the field study, compaction caused a reduction in total biomass production of 30\% and 14\% in snap bean and cabbage, respectively, while cucumber and sweet corn showed no significant response. The growth reductions of snap bean and cabbage in the greenhouse could not be attributed to compaction effects on soil water status, leaf turgor, nutrient deficiency, or net {CO}, assimilation rate of individual leaves. Root growth of sweet corn was least restricted by the compacted soil layer. The contrast between our field and greenhouse results indicates that the magnitude of yield response to compaction in the field was often associated with species sensitivity to secondary effects of compaction, such as prolonged flooding after rainfall events, reduced nutrient availability or uptake, and prolonged or more severe pest pressure.},

The root to shoot ratio (R:S, defined as dry weight o root biomass divided by dry weight of shoot biomass) depends upon the partitioning of photosynthate which m be influenced by environmental stimuli. Exposure of plant canopies to high {CO}2 concentration often stimulat the growth of both shoot and root, but the question remains whether elevated atmospheric {CO}2 concentration wi affect roots and shoots of crop plants proportionally. Since elevated {CO}2 can induce changes in plant structur and function, there may be differences in allocation between root and shoot, at least under some conditions. Th effect of elevated atmospheric {CO}2 on carbon allocation has yet to be fully elucidated, especially in the context changing resource availability. Herein we review root to shoot allocation as affected by increased concentratio of atmospheric {CO}2 and provide recommendations for further research. Review of the available literature shows substantial variation in R:S response for crop plants. In many cases (59.5\%) R:S increased, in a very few (3.0\%) remained unchanged, and in others (37.5\%) decreased. The explanation for these differences probably resides i crop type, resource supply, and other experimental factors. Efforts to understand allocation under {CO}2 enrichme will add substantially to the global change response data base.},

Here, five plant species (broad bean, pea, cabbage, fennel, and olive) grown under controlled pot conditions were tested for their ability to differently stimulate the degradation of standard litter. Litter, soil C and N contents were measured for evaluating chemical changes due to plant presence, while soil microbial abundance was evaluated to assess if it had a positive or negative catalyzing influence on litter decomposition. The architecture and morphological traits of roots systems were also evaluated by using specific open-source software ({SmartRoot}). Soil chemical and microbiological characteristics were significantly influenced by the plant species. Variations in soil C/N dynamics were correlated with the diversity of root traits among species. Early stage decomposition of the standard litter changed on the basis of the plant species. The results indicated that key soil processes are governed by interactions between plant roots, soil C and N, and the microbial metabolism that stimulate decomposition reactions. This, in turn, can have marked effects on soil chemical and microbiological fertility, both fundamental for sustaining crops, and can promote the development of new approaches for optimizing soil C and N cycling, managing nutrient transport, and sustaining and improving net primary production.},

	abstract = {Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are the primary elements involved in the growth and development of plants. The C:N ratio is an indicator of nitrogen use efficiency ({NUE}) and an input parameter for some ecological and ecosystem models. However, knowledge remains limited about the convergent or divergent variation in the C:N ratios among different plant organs (e.g., leaf, branch, trunk, and root) and how evolution and environment affect the coefficient shifts. Using systematic measurements of the leaf–branch–trunk–root of 2,139 species from tropical to cold-temperate forests, we comprehensively evaluated variation in C:N ratio in different organs in different taxa and forest types. The ratios showed convergence in the direction of change but divergence in the rate of change. Plants evolved toward lower C:N ratios in the leaf and branch, with N playing a more important role than C. The C:N ratio of plant organs (except for the leaf) was constrained by phylogeny, but not strongly. Both the change of C:N during evolution and its spatial variation (lower C:N ratio at midlatitudes) help develop the adaptive growth hypothesis. That is, plants with a higher C:N ratio promote {NUE} under strong N-limited conditions to ensure survival priority, whereas plants with a lower C:N ratio under less N-limited environments benefit growth priority. In nature, larger proportion of species with a high C:N ratio enabled communities to inhabit more N-limited conditions. Our results provide new insights on the evolution and drivers of C:N ratio among different plant organs, as well as provide a quantitative basis to optimize land surface process models.},

The major !"eason for yields of less than 15 tlha was reduced radiation interception (up to 37070) because of small leaf areas. This was probably caused by drought in most crops, but shortage of nitrogen, variable plant populations, weeds, and virus attack were also implicated at some sites. The efficiency of converting intercepted radiation to dry matter averaged 2.3 in 6 crops, but was about 2.0 in the other 2 crops (one affected by drought, the other by virus). Harvest index in most crops averaged 0.57, but was slightly lower in crops grown on the more fertile soils. Sugar yields were generally unaffected by soil type, but tops were heavier on the deeper soils. As the autumn progressed, top yields on the deep soils decreased and contained a higher proportion of crowns.},

The typical cropping systems of the area, i.e. arable rainfed ({ACR}) and irrigated crops ({ACI}) (cereals in rotation with irrigated tomato), vines ({VIN}), olives ({OLI}), and grasslands ({GL}) were considered. {RothC}10N simulations showed that {OLI} and {VIN} were able to store a considerable amount of C. Conversely, arable crops led to a reduction which was higher when the rotation included the irrigated tomato. The transition from arable to permanent crops (A2P) showed higher {SOC} stock increases than that from permanent to arable (P2A). The {CO}2-C released to the atmosphere was higher in {ACI}, P2A, and {VIN}, and lower in {OLI} and {GL}. Overall, in the year 2013 the total soil C stock in agricultural land across the province of Foggia was 19 Tg C, while the total {GHG} emission was 16.9 Tg {CO}2-C. The proposed methodology has proved to be effective to estimate the C stocks and emissions in the Mediterranean area and can be applied to assess the effect of specific land uses and land use change. Main land management recommendations to prevent soil organic C decline in the study area are: conservation tillage of arable lands, improvement of crop rotations, e.g. from continuous wheat to cropping systems including alfalfa or other legume crops, retention of crop residues into the field, rational use of irrigation for the summer crop, use of cover crops during the winter season to replace fallow periods, and supply of organic fertilizers (compost or manure).},

The crude protein, total digestible nutrients and extent of rumen degradability of dry matter ({DM}) of {VW} of households were 140.0 g kg−1, 0.668 and 0.855, respectively; while those of the marketplace were 169.0 g kg−1, 0.633 and 0.80, respectively.

The total aflatoxins in {VW} of households was 3.08 µg kg−1DM, and undetectable in {VW} from the marketplace. Considering the chemical composition and safety parameters studied, {VW} could preliminary be considered as animal feed. The feeding of processed marketplace {VW} ({VWP}) at 275 g kg−1DM of a diet or 0.76\% of live weight ({LW}) to growing bulls, replacing 50\% of a concentrate mixture as supplement to a Napier silage diet for a period of 34 days reduced the total {DM} intake (0.0276 vs 0.0343 {LW}) without any significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) changes in {DM} or protein digestibility. Blood urea levels (19.5 vs 23.67 mg dl−1), and serum creatinine levels (1.37 vs 1.08 mg dl−1) differed significantly (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between the two groups but were within normal physiological ranges. Therefore, it may be concluded that the level of incorporation of {VWP} would be less than 50\% replacement of the concentrate in the diet.

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon ({SOC}) is primarily formed from plant inputs, but the relative carbon (C) contributions from living root inputs (i.e. rhizodeposits) vs litter inputs (i.e. root + shoot litter) are poorly understood. Recent theory suggests that living root inputs exert a disproportionate influence on {SOC} formation, but few field studies have explicitly tested this by separately tracking living root vs litter inputs as they move through the soil food web and into distinct {SOC} pools. We used a manipulative field experiment with an annual C4 grass in a forest understory to differentially track its living root vs litter inputs into the soil and to assess net {SOC} formation over multiple years. We show that living root inputs are 2–13 times more efficient than litter inputs in forming both slow-cycling, mineral-associated {SOC} as well as fast-cycling, particulate organic C. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living root inputs are more efficiently anabolized by the soil microbial community en route to the mineral-associated {SOC} pool (dubbed ‘the in vivo microbial turnover pathway’). Overall, our findings provide support for the primacy of living root inputs in forming {SOC}. However, we also highlight the possibility of nonadditive effects of living root and litter inputs, which may deplete {SOC} pools despite greater {SOC} formation rates.},

	abstract = {Long-term intensive cultivation leads to the loss of soil organic carbon ({SOC}) in agricultural lands, which inevitably threatens food security and exacerbates greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions. The {RothC} model (Ver. 26.3win) is generally used to evaluate the changes in {SOC} and its responses to agricultural practices and climate change. However, previous calibrations of the {RothC} model emphasize the parameterization of C decomposition and neglect the effect of input data on the model accuracy. In this study, a long-term soil relocation experiment (1 m depth) in Chinese Mollisols was used to determine the effect of input parameters on the performance of the {RothC} model, and the optimal combination was filtered to evaluate the changes in {SOC} after 16 years of soil relocation. The results showed that the estimated C input from crop residues ranged from 1.22 to 2.53 t C ha−1 yr−1, and these inputs were insufficient to maintain the equilibrium state of the {SOC}. We also found a non-linear relationship between the initial {SOC} and C input, i.e., the largest C input amount was obtained under 3.24 \% {SOC} rather than 6.31 \% {SOC}. The difference in C input derived from estimation algorithms was the main source of model uncertainty. The simulation results indicated that from 2005 to 2020, the loss of {SOC} in Mollisols ranged from 2.54 to 13.90 t ha−1 when the initial {SOC} stocks were greater than 60 t ha−1, while the rate of {SOC} sequestration was 0.15 t ha−1 yr−1 when the {SOC} stocks was 33.03 t ha−1. Meanwhile, warming accelerated the loss and delayed the recovery of {SOC} in Mollisols. We suggested the equilibrium point of {SOC} in Mollisols under current agricultural practices was approximately 45 t ha−1. These results highlighted that Mollisols were an important C source of {GHG} and that a substantial capacity exists in {SOC} sequestration under conventional agricultural practices.},

	abstract = {{RothC} is an established model for predicting soil organic carbon ({SOC}) changes in response to environmental conditions and management. The model lacks algorithms for carbon input estimation and a differentiated consideration of carbon input sequestration from organic amendments commonly used in agriculture. Moreover, it does not consider the higher stability of below-ground crop residues in relation to above-ground crop residues. {RothC} was combined with two empirical approaches for quantifying carbon inputs from above- and below-ground crop residues and tested on 439 {SOC} data series from 36 arable long-term field experiments in Central and Northern Europe. Effects of carbon input quality on model fit were quantified with linear mixed models based on the analytical solution of {RothC}. Model parameters that describe the stability of incoming carbon were calibrated using a multi-site approach and Bayesian calibration. A second calibration study combined the determination of partitioning of incoming carbon into pools with different turnover rates and model responses to temperature and soil water content. With this calibration we showed that the contribution of above-ground residues to {SOC} is lower than when estimated with default {RothC} paramerization. We also show that the relative contribution from roots to {SOC} is higher than that from above-ground residues. Moreover, the degradability of organic amendments was highly variable between amendment categories and increased for all model configurations in the following order: farmyard manure {\textless} farmyard compost {\textless} sawdust {\textless} sewage sludge {\textless} peat. The proposed {RothC} partition coefficients for above-ground residues, roots and several commonly used organic amendments as estimated for this large data set should be useful for other studies in temperate climates. We also show that the analytical solution of {RothC} is closely related to the much simpler empirical humus balancing approaches used by farm advisory services. This provides opportunities to build bridges between the more process-oriented {SOC} models used in research and the well established instruments used by the farming community to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on {SOC} changes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the response of soil organic carbon ({SOC}) to environmental and management factors is necessary for estimating the potential of soils to sequester atmospheric carbon. Changes over time in the amount and distribution of {SOC} fractions with different turnover rates can be estimated by means of soil {SOC} models such as {RothC}, which typically consider two to five {SOC} pools. Ideally, these pools should correspond to measurable {SOC} fractions. The aim of this study was to test the relationship between {SOC} pools used in {RothC} and fractions separated through a fractionation procedure. A total of 123 topsoil samples from agricultural sites (arable land, grassland and alpine pasture) across Switzerland were used. A combination of physical and chemical methods resulted in two sensitive (particulate organic matter and dissolved organic carbon), two slow (carbon associated to clay and silt or stabilized in aggregates) and one passive (oxidation-resistant carbon) {SOM} fractions. These fractions were compared with the estimated equilibrium model pools when the corresponding soils were modelled with {RothC}. Analysis revealed strong correlations between {SOC} in measured fractions and modelled pools. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients varied between 0.82 for decomposable plant materials ({DPM}), 0.76 for resistant plant materials ({RPM}), 0.99 for humified organic matter ({HUM}) and biomass ({BIO}), and 0.73 for inert organic matter ({IOM}). The results show that the proposed fractionation procedure can be used with minor adaptations to identify measurable {SOC} fractions, which can be used to initialize and evaluate {RothC} for a wide range of site conditions.},

	abstract = {Process-based soil organic C ({SOC}) models are widely used for simulating, monitoring, and verifying soil C change. In such models, determining the initial distribution of {SOC} across multiple pools is often not well defined, yet pool initialization can strongly influence the subsequent {SOC} dynamics. We developed a model-based procedure to initialize {SOC} fractions that uses site-specific soil, climatic, and land use history information, along with measured initial total {SOC}, to estimate {SOC} distribution across pools. The procedure consists of creating sets of {SOC} fractions for scenarios including different field histories, soil texture, and management practices for medium- and long-term simulations to provide a broad spectrum of conditions, using data from an experimental site in Georgia. Tables created using this procedure can help model users select the {SOC} fractions needed to properly initialize the model. The model is executed for the duration of the prior land use history time period, and the simulated final total {SOC} is compared with the soil C measurement at the beginning of the subsequent experimental time period. If these values are equal, the final {SOC} fractions from the land use history simulations are used with the measured soil C to start the simulation of the cropping system being studied. If these values are not equal, then the procedure is repeated iteratively until the measured value of soil C is adequately predicted. We demonstrated the improved prediction accuracy by using the proposed procedure in simulating soil C for a long-term field experiment in Michigan.},

	abstract = {The subsoil below the regularly tilled topsoil stores large nutrient stocks and can retain water even under drought conditions. Mechanical soil profile modifications, commonly referred to as deep tillage, could improve the plant availability of these subsoil resources. However, field studies on the benefits of deep tillage have delivered inconsistent findings. Therefore, we (i) conducted a meta-analysis of crop yield responses to subsoiling (loosening), deep ploughing (turning+loosening) and deep mixing of soil profiles, and (ii) reviewed the relationship between site properties, management practices, water availability and deep tillage-induced changes in yield. The meta-analysis was based on 1530 yield comparisons between deep and ordinary tillage at 67 experimental sites in mostly temperate latitudes. On average, deep tillage slightly increased yield (+6\%). However, individual deep tillage effects were highly site-specific, including about 40\% documented yield depression after deep tillage. At sites with root-restricting, mostly compacted soil layers, the crop yield response to deep tillage was 20\% higher than at sites without such layers. In general, differences between deep tillage methods were less important than the presence of root-restricting soil layers. Soils with {\textgreater}70\% silt (labile soil structure) showed an increased risk of negative deep tillage effects. In growing seasons with dry spells, positive deep tillage effects were greater than in average years. Topsoil fertilisation buffered both extremely positive and negative deep tillage effects. Our results suggest that deep tillage increases the plant availability of subsoil nutrients, which increases crop yield if (i) nutrients are growth-limiting and (ii) deep tillage does not come at the cost of impaired topsoil fertility. On soils with stable soil structure and root-restricting layers, deep tillage can be an effective measure to mitigate drought stress and improve the resilience of crops under climate change conditions.},

	abstract = {Agricultural management can influence soil organic carbon ({SOC}) stocks and thus may contribute to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The soil depth to which agricultural management practices affect {SOC} is uncertain. Soil depth may have an important bearing on soil carbon dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to capture fully changes in {SOC} stocks. This applies in particular to the evaluation of carbon farming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the upper metre of mineral cropland soils from ten long-term experiments ({LTEs}) in Germany to quantify depth-specific effects on {SOC} stocks of common agricultural management practices: mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, a crop rotation with preceding crops (pre-crops), straw incorporation, application of farmyard manure ({FYM}), liming, and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction on {SOC} stocks were examined as a negative side effect of agricultural management. Results showed that 19 ± 3 \% of total management effects on {SOC} stocks were found in the upper subsoil (30–50 cm) and 3 ± 4 \% in the lower subsoil (50–100 cm), including all agricultural management practices with significant topsoil {SOC} effects, while 79 ± 7 \% of management effects were in the topsoil (0–30 cm). Nitrogen and {NPK} fertilisation were the treatments that had the greatest effect on subsoil organic carbon ({OC}) stocks, followed by irrigation, {FYM} application and straw incorporation. Sampling down to a depth of 50 cm resulted in significantly higher {SOC} effects than when considering topsoil only. A crop rotation with pre-crops, liming, reduced tillage and soil compaction did not significantly affect {SOC} stocks at any depth increment. Since approximately 20 \% of the impact of agricultural management on {SOC} stocks occurs in the subsoil, we recommend soil monitoring programs and carbon farming schemes extend their standard soil sampling down to 50 cm depth to capture fully agricultural management effects on {SOC}.},

	abstract = {Crop production often leads to soil organic carbon ({SOC}) losses. However, under good management practice it is possible to maintain and even re-accumulate {SOC}. We evaluated how different cropland management techniques affected {SOC} stocks in the topsoil (0–30 cm depth) of 10 long-term experiments ({LTE}) in Germany. We found that {SOC} stocks were particularly enhanced by mineral fertilization and organic amendments like straw incorporation and to a smaller degree by irrigation, but only slightly affected by the choice of preceding crops. In agreement with global meta-analyses, liming and reduced tillage had little or even negative effects on {SOC} storage, but effects also depended on fertilization. Management effects on {SOC} stocks were dependent on soil texture: sandy soils showed the lowest {SOC} stocks of 20.9 ± 2.3 (standard error of the mean) Mg ha−1, but exhibited the largest relative response to different management options. Annual changes in {SOC} stocks ranged from −3.0 ‰ with no mineral N fertilization, to + 6.1 ‰ with farmyard manure application, using the mineral-fertilized and limed treatment as reference. Even higher rates of up to + 10.6 ‰ yr−1 were reached with the combination of irrigation and straw incorporation. Note that the contribution of organic amendments to {SOC} accrual and thus to climate change mitigation must be adjusted for reduction in {SOC} at sites from which straw was removed. Overall, the potential of agricultural management to influence and enhance {SOC} stocks is significant. This potential is controlled by soil type and land-use duration, is largest for sandy soils with overall lowest {SOC} stocks, and is characterized by antagonistic and synergistic effects of different management practices.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide removal strategies are becoming increasingly important as a fundamental component of comprehensive climate policies. One strategy to increase carbon (C) sinks is the integration of hedgerows into agricultural landscapes. Besides additional C storage in above-ground and below-ground hedgerow biomass, the establishment of hedgerows has the potential to increase soil organic carbon ({SOC}) stocks. However, empirical data regarding the magnitude of {SOC} accrual with hedgerow establishment are still limited. We sampled 23 sites across Germany in a paired-plot approach with the aim of estimating {SOC} stock change with hedgerow establishment on cropland. At 21 sites, {SOC} stocks were higher beneath hedgerows than in the reference cropland. On average, {SOC} stock accrual was 29 ± 22 Mg ha−1 (36 ± 49 \%) in 0–100 cm soil depth. {SOC} stocks were significantly different in both topsoil and subsoil. Subsoils below 30 cm depth contributed 41 \% (12 ± 17 Mg C ha−1) of the total {SOC} stock change, stressing the importance of subsoil {SOC} for the total {SOC} stocks of hedgerow systems. The positive effect of hedgerows on {SOC} stocks extended laterally beyond the hedgerow area itself. {SOC} stock in the grassy hedgerow edge also increased significantly by 22 ± 22 Mg C ha−1 (28 ± 30 \%) and {SOC} stock in the cropland directly adjacent to the hedgerow were 9 ± 19 Mg C ha−1 (12 ± 25 \%) higher than in the reference cropland. Particularly high C stock differences between hedgerows and reference cropland soils were found in old hedgerows ({\textgreater}200 years) planted on hedgebanks, which are typically found in northern Germany. Our study confirmed that {SOC} stocks increase with hedgerow establishment on cropland throughout the whole soil profile. If hedgerows were to be established on 3 \% of Germany’s cropland area, {SOC} stocks would increase by 13 Tg C equivalent 48 Mio. t {CO}2, highlighting that hedgerows are a promising and multi-functional climate change mitigation option.},

	abstract = {The soil C saturation concept suggests a limit to whole soil organic carbon ({SOC}) accumulation determined by inherent physicochemical characteristics of four soil C pools: unprotected, physically protected, chemically protected, and biochemically protected. Previous attempts to quantify soil C sequestration capacity have focused primarily on silt and clay protection and largely ignored the effects of soil structural protection and biochemical protection. We assessed two contrasting models of {SOC} accumulation, one with no saturation limit (i.e., linear first-order model) and one with an explicit soil C saturation limit (i.e., C saturation model). We isolated soil fractions corresponding to the C pools (i.e., free particulate organic matter [{POM}], microaggregate-associated C, silt- and clay-associated C, and nonhydrolyzable C) from eight long-term agroecosystem experiments across the United States and Canada. Due to the composite nature of the physically protected C pool, we fractioned it into mineral- vs. {POM}-associated C. Within each site, the number of fractions fitting the C saturation model was directly related to maximum {SOC} content, suggesting that a broad range in {SOC} content is necessary to evaluate fraction C saturation. The two sites with the greatest {SOC} range showed C saturation behavior in the chemically, biochemically, and some mineral-associated fractions of the physically protected pool. The unprotected pool and the aggregate-protected {POM} showed linear, nonsaturating behavior. Evidence of C saturation of chemically and biochemically protected {SOC} pools was observed at sites far from their theoretical C saturation level, while saturation of aggregate-protected fractions occurred in soils closer to their C saturation level.},

However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state {SOC} stock with increasing C input levels suggesting that {SOC} can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C input levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model {SOM} dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C input levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation.},

	abstract = {We use a new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model ({TEM}), which has been parameterized to control for reactive soil organic carbon ({SOC}) across climatic gradients, to evaluate the sensitivity of {SOC} to a 1⚬ C warming in both empirical and process-based analyses. In the empirical analyses we use the steady state {SOC} estimates of {TEM} to derive {SOC}-response equations that depend on temperature and volumetric soil moisture, and extrapolate them across the terrestrial biosphere at 0.5⚬ spatial resolution. For contemporary climate and atmospheric {CO}2, mean annual temperature explains 34.8\% of the variance in the natural logarithm of {TEM}-estimated {SOC}. Because the inclusion of mean annual volumetric soil moisture in the regression explains an additional 19.6\%, a soil mosture term in an equation of {SOC} response should improve estimates. For a 1⚬ C warming, the globally derived empirical model estimates a terrestrial {SOC} loss of 22.6 1015 g (Pg), with 77.9\% of the loss in extra-tropical ecosystems. To explore whether loss estimates {SOC} are affected by the spatial scale at which the response equations are derived equations for each of the eighteen ecosystems considered in this study. The sensitivity of terrestrial {SOC} estimated by summing the losses predicted by each of the ecosystem empirical models is greater (27.9 Pg per ⚬ C) than that estimated by the global empirical model; the 12.2 Pg loss (43.7\%) in tropical ecosystems suggests that they may be more sensitive to warming. The global process-based loss of {SOC} estimated by {TEM} in response to a 1⚬ C warming (26.3 Pg) is similar to the sum of the ecosystem empirical losses, but the 13.6 Pg loss (51.7\%) in extra-tropical ecosystems suggests that they may be slightly less sensitive to warming. For the modelling of {SOC} responses, these results suggest that soil moisture is useful to incorporate in empirical models of {SOC} response and that globally derived empirical models may conceal regional sensitivity of {SOC} to warming. The analyses in this study suggest that the maximum loss of {SOC} to the atmosphere per⚬ C warming is less than 2\% of the terrestrial soil carbon inventory. Because the {NPP} response to elevated {CO}2 has the potential to compensate for this loss, the scenario of warming enhancing soil carbon loss to further enhance warming is unlikely in the absence of land use or changes in vegetation distribution.},

In this study we performed the established particle-size fractionation of soils from 54 intensively monitored sites in Germany and from archived samples from 5 other long-term experiments in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Rothamsted carbon ({RothC}) model was then used to compare the measured soil C fractionation from the 54 intensively monitored sites against modelled pools using spin-up equilibrium runs whilst dynamic (non-equilibrium) model runs were performed when comparing data from the long-term experiments. We detected good agreement between measured soil C fractions and modelled pools, indicated by correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.81 for the resistant plant material pool ({RPM}) and 0.91 and 0.94 for the humus pool ({HUM}) for the intensively monitored and the long-term sites, respectively. Slightly larger errors were detected for the intensively monitored sites together with a bias in the relationship between the {RPM} pool and particulate organic matter fraction. This bias detected for the intensively monitored sites indicated that the equilibrium assumption for arable agricultural sites, even though under crop cover for at least 50years, might not be entirely valid. From the relative mean absolute error of 11\% for the {HUM} pool and 26\% for the {RPM} pool of the combined data set we conform that the measured fractions can be used to estimate the {RothC} model pools in arable soils. Given the magnitude of these errors, however, we rather suggest to apply the fractionation approach instead of using an equilibrium assumption for the {RothC} initialisation of arable sites.},

	abstract = {The term carbon (C) sequestration has not just become a buzzword but is something of a siren's call to scientific communicators and media outlets. Carbon sequestration is the removal of C from the atmosphere and the storage, for example, in soil. It has the potential to partially compensate for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and is, therefore, an important piece in the global climate change mitigation puzzle. However, the term C sequestration is often used misleadingly and, while likely unintentional, can lead to the perpetuation of biased conclusions and exaggerated expectations about its contribution to climate change mitigation efforts. Soils have considerable potential to take up C but many are also in a state of continuous loss. In such soils, measures to build up soil C may only lead to a reduction in C losses (C loss mitigation) rather than result in real C sequestration and negative emissions. In an examination of 100 recent peer-reviewed papers on topics surrounding soil C, only 4\% were found to have used the term C sequestration correctly. Furthermore, 13\% of the papers equated C sequestration with C stocks. The review, further, revealed that measures leading to C sequestration will not always result in climate change mitigation when non-{CO}2 greenhouse gases and leakage are taken into consideration. This paper highlights potential pitfalls when using the term C sequestration incorrectly and calls for accurate usage of this term going forward. Revised and new terms are suggested to distinguish clearly between C sequestration in soils, {SOC} loss mitigation, negative emissions, climate change mitigation, {SOC} storage, and {SOC} accrual to avoid miscommunication among scientists and stakeholder groups in future.},

	abstract = {While Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ({WEEE}) collection and recovery have significantly gained in importance all over Europe in the last 15years, comprehensive studies assessing the environmental loads and benefits of these systems still are not common. In this paper we present the results of a combined material flow analysis and life cycle assessment study, which aimed to calculate the overall environmental impacts of collection, pre-processing and end-processing for the existing Swiss {WEEE} collection and recovery systems, as well as of incineration and landfilling scenarios, in which the same amount of {WEEE} is either incinerated in a an {MSWI} plant or landfilled. According to the calculations based on the material flow data for the year 2009 and a new version of the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database (ecoinvent v2.01), collection, recovery and disposal result in significantly lower environmental impacts per t of {WEEE} for midpoint indicators such as global warming or ozone depletion and the endpoint indicator Eco-Indicator '99 points. A comparison between the environmental impacts of the {WEEE} recovery scenarios 2009 and 2004, both calculated with ecoinvent v2.01 data, shows that the impacts per t of {WEEE} in 2009 were slightly lower. This appears to be mainly due to the changes in the treatment of plastics (more recycling, less incineration). Compared to the overall environmental impacts of the recovery scenario 2004 obtained with an old version of ecoinvent (ecoinvent v1.1), the calculation with ecoinvent v2.01 results in an increase of the impacts by about 20\%, which is primarily the consequence of a more adequate modeling of several {WEEE} fractions (e.g. metals, cables or {CRT} devices). In view of a further increase of the environmental benefits associated with the Swiss {WEEE} collection and recovery systems, the recovery of geochemically scarce metals should be further investigated, in particular.},

We conducted a survey in the upper Yellow River Delta of North China Plain. We collected 155 soil samples from 31 profiles, and measured {SOC}, {SIC} and soluble Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents. Our results showed that mean {SOC} content decreased from 9.30 g kg−1 near the surface to 2.36 g kg−1 in 80–100 cm whereas mean {SIC} content increased from 10.48 to 12.72 g kg−1. On average, {SOC} and {SIC} stocks over 0–100 cm were 5.73 kg C m−2 and 16.89 kg C m−2, respectively. There was a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.88, P {\textless} 0.001) between {SOC} and {SIC} in the cropland. We also found that {SIC} had a significantly positive correlation with both soluble Ca2+ (r = 0.57, P {\textless} 0.01) and Mg2+ (r = 0.43, P {\textless} 0.05). Our study suggested that increasing {SOC} might lead to an increase in {SIC} stocks in the cropland of North China Plain.

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2014.10.024},
	abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon ({SOC}) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on {SOC} stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing {SOC} stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher {SOC} stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with {SOC} stock change (R2=0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32±0.08Mgha−1yr−1 in a mean soil depth of 22cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear {SOC} accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average {SOC} stock change with the carbon turnover model {RothC}. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean {SOC} stock accumulation of 16.7±1.5Mgha−1 for a soil depth of 22cm. Thus, the C input driven {SOC} sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global {SOC} sequestration of 0.12±0.03PgCyr−1, which would compensate for 8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

We used a plant C allocation approach to estimate the C input of major crops and grassland into agricultural soils of Bavaria in southeast Germany.

The results revealed increases of the C input by 107–139\% for cereals, 173–188\% for root, forage and leguminous crops and 34\% for grassland in the last 60 years. This increase was related to linear yield increases until 1995 despite significant changes of plant C allocation. However, from 1995 onwards, crop yields and related C inputs stagnated, which allowed a robust estimation of recent crop-specific C input values. A total C input of 3.8–6.7tha−1yr−1 was estimated for cereals, 5.2–6.3tha−1yr−1 for root, forage and leguminous crops and 2.4tha−1yr−1 for grassland.

A generally high spatial variability of C inputs was detected within Bavaria with differences of up to 40\% between adjacent counties.

Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas.

	abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter ({OM}) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of {OM}, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred {OM}; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of {OM} against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil {OM} during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that {OM} stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any {OM} of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of {OM} is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for {SOM} stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of {SOM} dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

	abstract = {Vegetable production systems rely on frequent tillage to prepare beds and manage weeds, thereby accelerating losses of soil organic carbon ({SOC}). They are also characterised by scant crop residue input. Residue incorporation and organic fertiliser application could counteract {SOC} loss due to tillage. We tested this hypothesis in a Chromosol and a Vertosol in northern {NSW}, Australia, where the effects of incorporating sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa) residue in soil in a corn–cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) rotation under either organic or conventional system on soil C fractions were studied during two rotation cycles (2 years). A laboratory experiment was conducted to isolate the effect of tillage on the soil organic matter ({SOM}) fractions, because both the residue-incorporated and without-residue treatments for organic systems received tillage for weed control in the field, whereas conventional systems did not. Residue incorporation increased particulate {OC} ({POC}) by 32\% in the field experiment and 48\% in the laboratory experiment, whereas dissolved {OC} was increased only in the organic system. Concentrations of mineral-associated {OC} ({MOC}) and total {OC} ({TOC}) were increased by residue incorporation in both field and laboratory experiments. Simulated tillage had a limited effect on {POC}, {MOC} and {TOC}, suggesting that cultivation for weed control may have only a minor effect on short-term {SOM} mineralisation rates. In both experiments, {MOC} accounted for ≥83\% in the Vertosol and ≥73\% in the Chromosol. Due to frequent tillage in vegetable production systems, physicochemical stabilisation of C predominates over protection through aggregation.},

	abstract = {Feeding 9-10 billion people by 2050 and preventing dangerous climate change are two of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use {AFOLU} sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the {AFOLU} sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt {CO}2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt {CO}2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 {US}\$ {tCO}2 -eq. yr(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever.},

	abstract = {Organic farming relies, for soil fertility management, on proper rotation designs, Agro-ecological Service Crops ({ASCs}) and a sound use of on- and off-farm organic inputs. The right combination of soil fertility factors in organic farming is essential to enhance soil organic C ({SOC}) sequestration. A field trial experiment was overlaid on an long term organic farming experiment, in Monsampolo del Tronto (42° 53′ N, 13° 48′ E) in Central Italy, based on a 4-years rotation, with 6 main crops, and 3 different {ASCs}. The treatments included: i) the alternative termination of the cover crop (barley) with roller crimper technique compared to green manure and ii) the application of compost (not applied before) in different doses. The barley managements were: green manure ({GMB}); flattened ({FB}) by the use of a roller crimper; no barley ({NB}) as control. The compost (Cp) doses were: 0, 15 and 30 Mg C ha−1 to study the effect on soil C dynamics of compost application and {ASCs} termination techniques. The historic and experiment results were used as input to run a soil C dynamics model ({RothC}10N) to predict the effect of the factors different combinations in a medium term (20 years). After two years from compost application, the {SOC} stock increased in all plots, by +1.8, +2.3 and +4.9 Mg C ha−1 for Cp0, Cp15 and Cp30 respectively, compared to the initial stock of 36.8 Mg ha−1. The effect of different {ASCs} termination and {ASC} × compost interaction was not statistically significant. The {RothC}10N model was used to predict the effect of {ASCs} ({NoASCs}, {FB} and {GMB}) and Cp doses in a 20 years period. Predictions of the calibrated and validated {RothC}10N model showed that {SOC} change in 20 years was negative in the scenario with no {ASCs}-no compost ({NoASC} Cp0), where the C inputs were not sufficient to offset C losses, whereas positive values were predicted for all the other scenarios. The average values of predicted C stock change in 20 years were 3.8, 13.3 and 19.8 Mg C ha−1 for {NoASC}, {FB}, and {GMB} respectively and 8.2. 12.2 and 16.5 Mg C ha−1. for Cp0, Cp15 and Cp30. Both field experiment and model showed that the green manure of {ASC} and compost application represent a valid option in terms of carbon sequestration increase. {RothC}10N model can be used successfully as a tool to compare the C sequestration potential of alternative agronomic practices.},

	abstract = {Temperate grassland soils store significant amounts of carbon (C). Estimating how much livestock grazing and manuring can influence grassland soil organic carbon ({SOC}) is key to improve greenhouse gas grassland budgets. The Rothamsted Carbon ({RothC}) model, although originally developed and parameterized to model the turnover of organic C in arable topsoil, has been widely used, with varied success, to estimate {SOC} changes in grassland under different climates, soils, and management conditions. In this paper, we hypothesise that {RothC}-based {SOC} predictions in managed grasslands under temperate moist climatic conditions can be improved by incorporating small modifications to the model based on existing field data from diverse experimental locations in Europe. For this, we described and evaluated changes at the level of: (1) the soil water function of {RothC}, (2) entry pools accounting for the degradability of the exogenous organic matter ({EOM}) applied (e.g., ruminant excreta), (3) the month-on-month change in the quality of C inputs coming from plant residues (i.e above-, below-ground plant residue and rhizodeposits), and (4) the livestock trampling effect (i.e., poaching damage) as a common problem in areas with higher annual precipitation. In order to evaluate the potential utility of these changes, we performed a simple sensitivity analysis and tested the model predictions against averaged data from four grassland experiments in Europe. Our evaluation showed that the default model’s performance was 78\% and whereas some of the modifications seemed to improve {RothC} {SOC} predictions (model performance of 95\% and 86\% for soil water function and plant residues, respectively), others did not lead to any/or almost any improvement (model performance of 80 and 46\% for the change in the C input quality and livestock trampling, respectively). We concluded that, whereas adding more complexity to the {RothC} model by adding the livestock trampling would actually not improve the model, adding the modified soil water function and plant residue components, and at a lesser extent residues quality, could improve predictability of the {RothC} in managed grasslands under temperate moist climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {A new model, {RothPC}-1, is described for the turnover of organic C in the top metre of soil. {RothPC}-1 is a version of {RothC}-26.3, an earlier model for the turnover of C in topsoils. In {RothPC}-1 two extra parameters are used to model turnover in the top metre of soil: one, p, which moves organic C down the profile by an advective process, and the other, s, which slows decomposition with depth. {RothPC}-1 is parameterized and tested using measurements (described in Part 1, this issue) of total organic C and radiocarbon on soil profiles from the Rothamsted long-term field experiments, collected over a period of more than 100 years. {RothPC}-1 gives fits to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon in the 0–23, 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm layers of soil that are almost all within (or close to) measurement error in two areas of regenerating woodland (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and an area of cultivated land from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. The fits to old grassland (the Park Grass Experiment) are less close. Two other sites that provide the requisite pre- and post-bomb data are also fitted; a prairie Chernozem from Russia and an annual grassland from California. Roth-{PC}-1 gives a close fit to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon down the Chernozem profile, provided that allowance is made for soil age; with the annual grassland the fit is acceptable in the upper part of the profile, but not in the clay-rich Bt horizon below. Calculations suggest that treating the top metre of soil as a homogeneous unit will greatly overestimate the effects of global warming in accelerating the decomposition of soil C and hence on the enhanced release of {CO}2 from soil organic matter; more realistic estimates will be obtained from multi-layer models such as {RothPC}-1.},

	abstract = {Soil carbon modeling is an important tool to inform scientists, land managers, and policy makers about the impacts of land management decisions on soil health and climate change mitigation. Models can require a wide range of data inputs to make predictions, not all of which are readily available but can often be substituted with estimates. Understanding the impact that inputs have on the model output is critical to understand the uncertainties of their predictions. This study evaluated the output of the {RothC} soil carbon model using three potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) models (Tegos et al., 2017; Droogers and Allan, 2002; and Thornthwaite and Mather, 1955; Te, {DA}, and {TM}, respectively) to estimate open pan evaporation, and three vegetation indices ({NDVI}, {SAVI}, and {MSAVI}) from satellite imagery to estimate corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield to convert to C input for the {RothC} model to predict soil organic carbon over 11 years at a research farm in Michigan. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the correlation with observed data for each estimated input as well as the variability in {RothC} output they produced. The {TM}, Te, and {DA} {PET} models resulted in 13\%, 38\%, and 40\% wet bias, respectively, resulting in increases of 1.6, 5.5 and 7.4 Mg C ha−1, respectively, over the baseline model output. All three vegetation indices estimated corn yields poorly (R2 = 0.25, 0.26, and 0.26 for {NDVI}, {SAVI}, and {MSAVI}, respectively), but soybean yields exceptionally well (all R2 = 0.91). However, despite {NDVI} producing significantly higher values (p {\textless} 0.001), there were no significant differences between each index's estimated yield used to calculate C input for {RothC}, and the resulting model runs are almost indistinguishable.},

This is why it is a promising solution for carbon farming in Mediterranean areas. Models are used to project the effects of agricultural practices on soil organic carbon in the future for various soil and climatic conditions, and to help policy makers and farmers assess the best way to implement carbon farming strategies. Here, we modified the widely used {RothC} model to include mulching practices and their direct and indirect effects on soil organic matter input, soil temperature changes, and soil hydraulic balance. We then calibrated and tested our modified {RothC} ({RothC}\_MM) using the dataset collected in two field mulching experiments, and we used the tested {RothC}\_MM to estimate the expected soil carbon sequestration due to mulching by the year 2050 for the Valencian Community (Spain). Our results show that {RothC}\_MM improved the fit with the experimental data with respect to basic {RothC}; {RothC}\_MM was able to model the effects of mulch on soil temperature and soil water content and to predict soil organic carbon ({SOC}) and {CO}2 observations taken in the field.},

	abstract = {{RothC} is an established model for predicting soil organic carbon ({SOC}) changes in response to environmental conditions and management. The model lacks algorithms for carbon input estimation and a differentiated consideration of carbon input sequestration from organic amendments commonly used in agriculture. Moreover, it does not consider the higher stability of below-ground crop residues in relation to above-ground crop residues. {RothC} was combined with two empirical approaches for quantifying carbon inputs from above- and below-ground crop residues and tested on 439 {SOC} data series from 36 arable long-term field experiments in Central and Northern Europe. Effects of carbon input quality on model fit were quantified with linear mixed models based on the analytical solution of {RothC}. Model parameters that describe the stability of incoming carbon were calibrated using a multi-site approach and Bayesian calibration. A second calibration study combined the determination of partitioning of incoming carbon into pools with different turnover rates and model responses to temperature and soil water content. With this calibration we showed that the contribution of above-ground residues to {SOC} is lower than when estimated with default {RothC} paramerization. We also show that the relative contribution from roots to {SOC} is higher than that from above-ground residues. Moreover, the degradability of organic amendments was highly variable between amendment categories and increased for all model configurations in the following order: farmyard manure {\textless} farmyard compost {\textless} sawdust {\textless} sewage sludge {\textless} peat. The proposed {RothC} partition coefficients for above-ground residues, roots and several commonly used organic amendments as estimated for this large data set should be useful for other studies in temperate climates. We also show that the analytical solution of {RothC} is closely related to the much simpler empirical humus balancing approaches used by farm advisory services. This provides opportunities to build bridges between the more process-oriented {SOC} models used in research and the well established instruments used by the farming community to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on {SOC} changes.},

	abstract = {Historically, soils have lost 40–90 Pg carbon (C) globally through cultivation and disturbance with current rates of C loss due to land use change of about 1.6 ± 0.8 Pg C y−1, mainly in the tropics. Since soils contain more than twice the C found in the atmosphere, loss of C from soils can have a significant effect of atmospheric {CO}2 concentration, and thereby on climate. Halting land-use conversion would be an effective mechanism to reduce soil C losses, but with a growing population and changing dietary preferences in the developing world, more land is likely to be required for agriculture. Maximizing the productivity of existing agricultural land and applying best management practices to that land would slow the loss of, or is some cases restore, soil C. There are, however, many barriers to implementing best management practices, the most significant of which in developing countries are driven by poverty. Management practices that also improve food security and profitability are most likely to be adopted. Soil C management needs to considered within a broader framework of sustainable development. Policies to encourage fair trade, reduced subsidies for agriculture in developed countries and less onerous interest on loans and foreign debt would encourage sustainable development, which in turn would encourage the adoption of successful soil C management in developing countries. If soil management is to be used to help address the problem of global warming, priority needs to be given to implementing such policies.},

	abstract = {Adopting no-tillage in agro-ecosystems has been widely recommended as a means of enhancing carbon (C) sequestration in soils. However, study results are inconsistent and varying from significant increase to significant decrease. It is unclear whether this variability is caused by environmental, or management factors or by sampling errors and analysis methodology. Using meta-analysis, we assessed the response of soil organic carbon ({SOC}) to conversion of management practice from conventional tillage ({CT}) to no-tillage ({NT}) based on global data from 69 paired-experiments, where soil sampling extended deeper than 40cm. We found that cultivation of natural soils for more than 5 years, on average, resulted in soil C loss of more than 20tha−1, with no significant difference between {CT} and {NT}. Conversion from {CT} to {NT} changed distribution of C in the soil profile significantly, but did not increase the total {SOC} except in double cropping systems. After adopting {NT}, soil C increased by 3.15±2.42tha−1 (mean±95\% confidence interval) in the surface 10cm of soil, but declined by 3.30±1.61tha−1 in the 20–40cm soil layer. Overall, adopting {NT} did not enhance soil total C stock down to 40cm. Increased number of crop species in rotation resulted in less C accumulation in the surface soil and greater C loss in deeper layer. Increased crop frequency seemed to have the opposite effect and significantly increased soil C by 11\% in the 0–60cm soil. Neither mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall nor nitrogen fertilization and duration of adopting {NT} affected the response of soil C stock to the adoption of {NT}. Our results highlight that the role of adopting {NT} in sequestrating C is greatly regulated by cropping systems. Increasing cropping frequency might be a more efficient strategy to sequester C in agro-ecosystems. More information on the effects of increasing crop species and frequency on soil C input and decomposition processes is needed to further our understanding on the potential ability of C sequestration in agricultural soils.},

The link to food production is crucial because crop types and livestock numbers influence soil organic C ({SOC}) stocks, through soil C inputs from plants and manure. We estimated {SCS} rates for the years 2020–2050 for three scenarios, each with two variants for biochar: cover cropping (0.30 t {CO}2 equivalents [{CO}2-eq] ha−1 yr−1), biochar addition (0.36–1.8 t {CO}2-eq ha−1 yr−1) and agroforestry-biochar addition (2.2–2.3 t {CO}2-eq ha−1 yr−1). Different limiting factors (land and biomass availability, population growth) affected {SCS} rates and indicated that they cannot be sustained until 2100 under all scenarios (cover cropping: 0.10 t {CO}2-eq ha−1 yr−1 [2051–2100]; biochar addition: 0.35–1.8 t {CO}2-eq ha−1 yr−1; agroforestry-biochar addition: 1.0–1.7 t {CO}2-eq ha−1 yr−1). This information together with the associated {GHG} emissions is critical for planning net zero strategies and highlights the importance of integrated assessments that capture links between {SCS} and the food system.},

	abstract = {The topsoil Land Use and Cover Area frame Statistical survey ({LUCAS}) aims at collecting harmonised data about the state of soil health over the extent of European Union ({EU}). In the {LUCAS} 2018 survey, bulk density has been analysed for three depths, i.e., 0–10 cm = 6140 sites; 10–20 cm = 5684 sites and 20–30 cm =139 sites. The laboratory analysis and the assessment of the results conclude that the bulk density at 10–20 cm is 5–10\% higher compared to 0–10 cm for all land uses except woodlands (20\%). In the 0–20 cm depth, croplands have 1.5 times higher bulk density (mean: 1.26 g cm−3) compared to woodlands (mean: 0.83 g cm−3). The main driver for bulk density variation is the land use which implies that many existing pedotransfer rules have to be developed based on land use. This study applied a methodological framework using an advanced Cubist rule-based regression model to optimize the spatial prediction of bulk density in Europe. We spatialised the circa 6000 {LUCAS} samples and developed the high-resolution map (100 m) of bulk density for the 0–20 cm depth and the maps at 0–10 and 10–20 cm depth. The modelling results showed a very good prediction (R2: 0.66) of bulk density for the 0–20 cm depth which outperforms previous assessments. The bulk density maps can be used to estimate packing density which is a proxy to estimate soil compaction. Therefore, this work contributes to monitoring soil health and refine estimates on carbon and nutrients stocks in the {EU} topsoil.},

	abstract = {Simulating cropland soil carbon changes following a reduction in tillage intensity is necessary to determine the utility of this management practice in climate change mitigation. In instances where reduced or no tillage increases soil carbon stocks, this is typically due to reduced decomposition rates of plant residues. Although some soil carbon models contain a priori decomposition rate modifiers to account for tillage regime, these are typically not calibrated to specific climatic regions, and none are currently available for the Rothamsted Carbon Model ({RothC}). Here, we present a modelling framework to estimate a tillage rate modifier ({TRM}) for the decomposition rate constants in {RothC}-26.3 which determine decay between soil carbon pools. We demonstrate this for north-west Europe, using published data assembled through a recent systematic review with propagation of error from input parameters throughout the framework. The small magnitude of soil carbon change following a reduction in tillage intensity in this region is reflected in our {TRM} estimates for no-till of 0.95, with 95\% Credible Intervals [0.91, 1.00], and reduced tillage of 0.93 [0.90, 0.97], relative to conventional high-intensity tillage with a default {TRM} of 1. These {TRMs} facilitate realistic simulation of soil carbon dynamics following a reduction of tillage intensity using {RothC}, and our simple, transparent, and repeatable modelling framework is suitable for application in other climatic regions using input data generalisable to the context of interest.},

	abstract = {We revisited the well documented and ongoing long-term 'Ultuna continuous soil organic matter field experiment' which started in 1956 at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The objective of the experiment is to quantify effects of six organic amendments and mineral N fertilizers on the crop and soil. We used the ‘equivalent soil mass’ concept for estimating changes in the topsoil C stocks in all 15 treatments. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop yields. Clustering C inputs into seven categories by quality allowed us to calculate a ‘humification’ coefficient for each category. Here, these coefficients simply were based on the fraction of total C input that still remains in the topsoil after about 50 years. As indicated by previous studies, this coefficient was highest for peat, followed by sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and aboveground crop residues. The most interesting result from the current investigation is that the optimized coefficient for rootderived C was about 2.3 times higher than that for aboveground plant residues. The calculated results were found to be robust in a sensitivity analysis. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that root-derived C contributes more to relatively stable soil C pools than the same amount of aboveground crop residue-derived C.},

Advantages due to coupling of two different tracer techniques are shown. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between plant species (cereals, grasses, and trees) are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20\%—30\% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in {CO}2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of rootborne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter. The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30\%—50\% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1500 kg C ha—1), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1500 and 2200 kg C ha—1, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived {CO}2 efflux from the soil.},

	abstract = {The ability of plants to respond appropriately to nutrient availability is of fundamental importance for their adaptation to the environment. Nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate, sulfate and iron act as signals that can be perceived. These signals trigger molecular mechanisms that modify cell division and cell differentiation processes within the root and have a profound impact on root system architecture. Important developmental processes, such as root-hair formation, primary root growth and lateral root formation, are particularly sensitive to changes in the internal and external concentration of nutrients. The responses of root architecture to nutrients can be modified by plant growth regulators, such as auxins, cytokinins and ethylene, suggesting that the nutritional control of root development may be mediated by changes in hormone synthesis, transport or sensitivity. Recent information points to the existence of nutrient-specific signal transduction pathways that interpret the external and internal concentrations of nutrients to modify root development. Progress in this field has led to the cloning of regulatory genes that play pivotal roles in nutrient-induced changes to root development.},

	abstract = {The effects of plants on the biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are key determinants of terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on the literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we reviewed 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of root system traits, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluated the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that belowground traits with the broadest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis-based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with the strongest links on functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.},

Element losses were derived from mass balance calculations that are based on enrichment/depletion factors using immobile element contents (Ti). Mass balance calculations indicated that extensive mineral weathering resulted in significant leaching losses of major base cations (with losses up to {\textgreater}80\% of the initial content in the parent material), Al (particularly, from upper horizons) and Si. Element denudation was greatest in subalpine forests near the timberline. Weathering rates decreased with both higher and lower altitudes. The pattern of smectite distribution along the climosequence has strong similarities to the Al, Si, Na and K losses, while an inverse trend could be detected for clay minerals with a high amount of interlayered Al. Highest smectite contents with up to 30\% of the clay fraction and also highest weathering rates were found at sites in subalpine forest near the timberline. Higher precipitation rates and the production of chelating compounds in the soil are believed to promote the appearance of smectites. Weathering rates of Na and K were additionally modelled as a function of precipitation and temperature. The relationship between climate and element weathering is strongly nonlinear and is thought to be overshadowed by the pronounced podzolisation effect near the timberline.},

The model rate constant for plant litter decomposition was adjusted by {pH} response functions derived from (i) published data of litter decomposition or soil N dynamics and (ii) a best fit through the radiocarbon-derived turnover rates. After parameterization, the match of radiocarbon-based and model-based values was significantly improved for both rate constants and pool sizes.

These characteristics included pathogenicity to the two Lygus spp., in vitro conidia production, temperature growth optima, tolerance to solar radiation, and production of beauvericin. Comparisons were made with a commercial isolate ({GHA}). Isolates from L. hesperus and L. lineolaris were more pathogenic than {GHA} with many being more than an order of magnitude more pathogenic based on {LC}50 values. All isolates from L. hesperus and two from L. lineolaris grew faster at 32°C than {GHA}. The isolates selected from L. hesperus were the most tolerant to exposure to simulated solar radiation. Isolates from L. lineolaris and L. hesperus were most closely related to other isolates from their same host species and all of these isolates were only distantly related to {GHA}. Interestingly, one isolate from L. lineolaris in Mississippi was more closely related to an isolate from L. lineolaris in Arkansas than to other isolates from L. lineolaris from the same county in Mississippi. Optimizing conidia production conditions for a select isolate may be necessary for practical development of a select isolate from Lygus spp. as a commercial mycoinsecticide.},

Observations on the life-cycle of L. rugulipennis in England have been carried out and they show that there are normally two generations per year; the second generation becomes adult in the autumn and overwinters in this stage, egg-laying occurring the following spring.

In this paper we discuss the influence of moisture and rates of N application on such ratios for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in the semi-arid region of the Canadian prairies. Under natural rainfall root/straw (nongrain aboveground material), ratios decreased with increasing rates of N, but under irrigation these ratios were generally constant. We estimated root/straw ratios for roots measured at anthesis (their maximum mass) and straw measured at maturity, under natural rainfall conditions, to be 0.36–0.58 if roots are assessed for the 0 - to 120-cm depth, 0.21–0.34 for the 0 - to 30-cm depth, and 0.15–0.26 for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Under natural rainfall, if roots are measured at maturity (as is commonly done), the corresponding ratios were 0.29–0.37, 0.15–0.21, and 0.10–0.15, for the respective depths. Under irrigation, the ratios when roots were measured at anthesis were 0.36, 0.24 and 0.19 for 0- to 120-cm, 0- to 30-cm and 0- to 15-cm rooting depths, respectively; but when roots were measured at maturity these ratios were 0.30, 0.17 and 0.13, respectively. We suggest that the values based on roots measured at anthesis provide a more accurate estimate of root C available for decomposition. We propose that the ratio used should be dependent on the depth to which changes in soil C or N are being measured. Key words: Soil organic C, roots, straw, fertilizer N, moisture},

A field experiment was made on a Typic Cryoboroll in 1990 with two barley cultivars to study the above- and below-ground transformation of photosynthetically fixed C in barley-soil systems. The barley cultivars (Abee and Samson) were grown on three replicate plots using a factorial split-plot design. Microplots were destructively sampled 15 days after pulse-labelling. The total 14C activity in shoots and roots of Samson was significantly higher than that of Abee over the growing season. The ratio of shoot 14C: root 14C increased faster for Abee than for Samson over the growing season. In contrast, the 14C remaining in soil, and in microbial biomass and water-soluble organic-C was significantly higher for Samson than for Abee at the stem extension and heading stages but there were no differences at the tillering and ripening stages. Root 14C was correlated with soil 14C. Most of 14C respired by soil microorganisms during a 10-day incubation came from water-soluble organic-14C, which indicated that water-soluble organic-C is very available to soil microorganisms. A greater proportion of photosynthetically fixed C was stabilized in soil under Samson than under Abee.

The agronomic performance, weed-crop interactions and below-ground productivity of these cropping systems were examined. The main findings were as follows: different soil properties did not affect yields of barley, barley/field pea and fescue fertilized with N and P; silage yield of faba bean at Breton was greater than at Ellerslie; barley/field pea and faba bean could be grown without tillage at Ellerslie; barley/field pea plots had the lowest weed counts; fescue root biomass was greatest at all depths followed by faba bean and barley; and soil properties appeared not to induce differences in root production of a cereal, an annual forage legume and a perennial grass. Increasing the use of annual legumes into rotations, either as sole crops or as intercrops with cereals, may be a viable alternative to continuous cereal cropping because annual legumes contribute N through biological N fixation, reduce weed competition and increase the input of root mass in soil.},

	abstract = {Land use change strongly affects soil organic carbon ({SOC}), which is a critical driving force for soil quality and soil services. However, the influence of detailed land use dynamics on {SOC} remains an active research field. We investigated the impact of long-term grass-/cropland conversion dynamics on {SOC} for the Swiss agroecosystem (8‵500 km2). In Switzerland multi-temporal {SOC} observations are sparse, while the spatio-temporal resolution of available land use data is inadequate to capture small structured and dynamic land use. Thus, we stratified one-time {SOC} observations of two periods (n1995–1999 = 1096; n2011–2015 = 502) into typical land use classes of grass-/cropland conversion regimes to analyze states and trends of {SOC}. First, based on spectral imagery and auxiliary variables, we established a Random Forest classifier to detect annual grass-/cropland distributions in a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m for 2000–2015. Second, we used the annual land use maps to derive classes of typical land use dynamics based on a pattern description of conversion regimes. Third, we comparatively assessed the {SOC} covariate importance ({IMP}) and {SOC} sample representation of land use dynamics using terrain and climate covariates. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed {SOC} across land use dynamics and two periods. The land use classifier shows an Overall Accuracy of 86\%, while the annual land use maps deviate by 6\%–11\% from census data. 46\% of the farmland underlies frequent grass-/cropland conversions. The {SOC} covariate importance of land use dynamics is increased by at least 2.4 times compared to the {SOC} covariates. The {SOC} observations consistently represent land use dynamics across {SOC} covariates. In both periods, {SOC} increased as the grassland share within the land use regimes increased. The mean {SOC} for permanent grasslands is 35 g kg−1 and 17 g kg−1 for permanent croplands. Areas of land use conversions where grassland is dominant show increased {SOC} (29–30 g kg−1) compared to areas where cropland was dominant (23–25 g kg−1). The mean differences of {SOC} between the periods and classes are statistically not significant except for permanent cropland, for which the {SOC} is decreased by 5.2 g kg−1.},

	abstract = {The application of dynamic models to report changes in soil organic carbon ({SOC}) stocks, for example as part of greenhouse gas inventories, is becoming increasingly important. Most of these models rely on input data from harvest residues or decaying plant parts and also organic fertilizer, together referred to as soil carbon inputs (C). The soil C inputs from plants are derived from measured agricultural yields using allometric equations. Here we compared the results of five previously published equations. Our goal was to test whether the choice of method is critical for modelling soil C and if so, which of these equations is most suitable for Swiss conditions. For this purpose we used the five equations to calculate soil C inputs based on yield data from a Swiss long-term cropping experiment. Estimated annual soil C inputs from various crops were averaged from 28 years and four fertilizer treatments; the average was 3.6 Mg C ha−1 and covered a surprisingly large range from 2.1 to 5.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1 among the five equations. For single crop species, differences reached 6.6 Mg C ha−1 year−1. The variation between estimated soil C inputs depended on crop type and increased with yield. Simulations with the model C-{TOOL} showed that calculated {SOC} stocks were affected strongly by the choice of the allometric equation. With four equations, a decrease in {SOC} stocks was simulated, whereas with one equation there was no change. This considerable uncertainty in modelled soil C is attributable solely to the allometric equation used to estimate the soil C input. We identify the evaluation and selection of allometric equations and associated coefficients as critical steps when setting up a model-based soil C inventory for agricultural systems. Highlights Uncertainty analyses in soil C modelling have focused mainly on model parameters and structures. The uncertainty related to estimation of soil C inputs from crop residues was calculated. Simulated soil C stocks and stock changes depend strongly on the method of estimating C input. The method to derive soil C inputs is critical for model-based soil C inventories.},

	abstract = {The grain legume (pulse) faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is grown world-wide as a protein source for food and feed. At the same time faba bean offers ecosystem services such as renewable inputs of nitrogen (N) into crops and soil via biological N-2 fixation, and a diversification of cropping systems. Even though the global average grain yield has almost doubled during the past 50 years the total area sown to faba beans has declined by 56\% over the same period. The season-to-season fluctuations in grain yield of faba bean and the progressive replacement of traditional farming systems, which utilized legumes to provide N to maintain soil N fertility, with industrialized, largely cereal-based systems that are heavily reliant upon fossil fuels (=N fertilizers, heavy mechanization) are some of the explanations for this decline in importance. Past studies of faba bean in cropping systems have tended to focus on the effect of faba bean as a pre-crop in mainly cereal intensive rotations, whereas similar information on the effect of preceding crops on faba bean is lacking. Faba bean has the highest average reliance on N-2 fixation for growth of the major cool season grain legumes. As a consequence the N benefit for following crops is often high, and several studies have demonstrated substantial savings (up to 100-200 kg N ha(-1)) in the amount of N fertilizer required to maximize the yield of crops grown after faba bean. There is, however, a requirement to evaluate the potential risks of losses of N from the plant-soil system associated with faba bean cropping via nitrate leaching or emissions of N2O to the atmosphere as a consequence of the rapid mineralization of N from its N-rich residues. It is important to develop improved preventive measures, such as catch crops, intercropping, or no-till technologies, in order to provide farmers with strategies to minimize any possible undesirable effects on the environment that might result from their inclusion of faba bean in cropping system. This needs to be combined with research that can lead to a reduction in the current extent of yield variability, so that faba bean may prove to be a key component of future arable cropping systems where declining supplies and high prices of fossil energy are likely to constrain the affordability and use of fertilizers. This will help address the increasing demand by consumers and governments for agriculture to reduce its impact on the environment and climate through new, more sustainable approaches to food production. The aims of this paper are to review the role of faba bean in global plant production systems, the requirements for optimal faba bean production and to highlight the beneficial effects of faba bean in cropping systems.

The Candy Carbon Balance ({CCB}) model has been validated using a dataset from 40 long-term experiments situated in Central Europe including 391 treatments with a total number of 4794 C-org observations.

In addition a number of tests were performed to make sure that the model has no systematic error for different types of site conditions and management activities. After this successful validation the {CCB} model is considered applicable for advisory service for arable fields on a wide range of site conditions.

The methodology and the proposed conversion factors can be applied to any region of the planet, with some exception to be noted in the text. The biomass produced in agro-ecosystems by transforming energy flows (solar and, currently, fossil) and mobilizing nutrients and water are the operational basis of traditional and, to some extent, industrialised societies. The quantification of {NPP} of agroecosystems, and biomass flows that are configured from this, is essential to build metabolic profiles and to inquire in agrarian sustainability of traditional agrarian and industrial societies. The provided information herein may be useful for researchers working in Agrarian Social Metabolism, Greenhouse Gas Balances of agroecosystems and Climate Change, and Energy Return on Investment ({EROI}’s) in agro-ecosystems among other methodological approaches.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Regenerative agriculture is an alternative means of producing food that, its advocates claim, may have lower—or even net positive—environmental and/or social impacts. Regenerative agriculture has recently received significant attention from producers, retailers, researchers, and consumers, as well as politicians and the mainstream media. Despite widespread interest in regenerative agriculture, no legal or regulatory definition of the term “regenerative agriculture” exists nor has a widely accepted definition emerged in common usage. This paper answers the research question: How have different scholars and practitioners defined regenerative agriculture? We reviewed 229 journal articles and 25 practitioner websites to characterize the term “regenerative agriculture.” Our review revealed that there were many definitions and descriptions of regenerative agriculture in usage. These were variously based on processes (e.g., use of cover crops, the integration of livestock, and reducing or eliminating tillage), outcomes (e.g., to improve soil health, to sequester carbon, and to increase biodiversity), or combinations of the two. Process-based definitions may imply that advocates or users of such definitions are open-minded about the possible outcomes of these processes. Similarly, outcome-based definitions may imply that users of such definitions are open-minded about the processes that may lead to those outcomes. We discuss the implications of these different forms of definition for policy, including for certification programs and for payments for carbon sequestration programs. More generally, wide variance in the definitions used may lead to uncertainty about what different actors mean when they talk about regenerative agriculture. We suggest that it may be helpful for individual users of the term “regenerative agriculture” to define it comprehensively for their own purpose and context.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Can regenerative agriculture ({RA}) produce an adequate amount of nutritious food for the growing and increasingly affluent world population while also reducing and offsetting some anthropogenic emissions? The question may be reframed: how can {RA} be adapted to produce enough food, be a negative emission technology, and advance Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (2015)? System-based {RA} reconciles the need of producing adequate and nutritious food with the necessity of restoring the environment, making farming a solution to environmental issues. It encompasses a wide range of farming and grazing practices aimed at restoration and sustainable management of soil health through sequestration of soil organic carbon (C). There is no one-size-fits-all practice for diverse soils and ecoregions. {RA} comprises system-based conservation agriculture ({CA}), which includes no-till farming in conjunction with residue mulching, cover cropping, integrated nutrient and pest management, complex rotations, and integration of crops with trees and livestock (figure 1) (Lal 2015). {RA} is all inclusive, and its site-specific package(s) must be fine-tuned in the context of biophysical factors and the human dimensions. {RA} is soil-centric rather than seed-centric and is based on the premise that “health of soil, plants, animals, and humans is one and indivisible” (Howard 1943;…},

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between {HI} and yield for major crops to improve the estimation of aboveground crop residue inputs to agricultural soils in cold continental climates. We analyzed yield and {HI} data for 11 major crops from published field studies in a cold continental climate. Significant linear relationships between {HI} and crop yield were determined for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) (R2=0.19–0.65, P{\textless}0.05), while {HI} of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) did not change with yield. The {HI} increased by 0.015 for wheat and maize to 0.110 for flax for each Mgha−1 yield increase. Results for wheat, lentil, flax, and maize showed that crop {HI} was significantly influenced by grain yield (P{\textless}0.01) but not significantly (P{\textgreater}0.05) affected by cultivar when the grain yield effect was included. These results indicated that cultivar effect appears to be largely captured through crop yield, so it does not appear to be essential to know the cultivar to estimate the {HI} for an annual series of regional yields from different cultivars. The developed relationships between {HI} and crop yield allow improved estimation of residue inputs in cold continental climates.},

	abstract = {Simple measures of appropriate levels of soil organic matter are needed for soil evaluation, management and monitoring, based on readily measurable soil properties. We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon ({SOC}) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of {SOC}/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978–83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil {pH} together explained 21\% of the variance in {SOC}/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of {SOC}/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between “very good”, “good”, “moderate” and “degraded” levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6\% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the dataset used to test the index, we suggest it should apply to other European soils in similar climate zones. Highlights We assess the use of {SOC}/clay ratios as guidelines for soil management in England and Wales. We use data from 3,809 sites to assess thresholds based on work for Polish, French and Swiss soils. {SOC}/clay threshold values can indicate degraded and good soil structural condition. The thresholds show the effect of land use and provide an index for use in England and Wales.},

Texture, mineralogy, and {SOC}:clay ratio are also acknowledged to affect physical properties, however there is no consensus or general conclusions in this respect. Against this background, the present study aims at determining objectives for the management of {SOC} in terms of structural quality of agricultural soils. The large area in which 161 free-to-swell undisturbed samples were obtained for this research represents a major part of the Swiss agricultural land and belongs to one broad soil group (Cambi-Luvisols). The structural quality was scored visually, and bulk volumes (inverse of bulk density) were measured at standard matric potentials. To define the effect of {SOC} without interference of soil mechanical degradation, soils with good structural quality scores were considered first in studying the relationship between {SOC} and soil pore volumes. Results suggest that the relationship is always linear, irrespective of the clay content of the soils. No optimum of {SOC} corresponding to a fraction of the clay content is found, contrary to the theory of “complexed organic carbon” (Dexter et al., 2008). However, the {SOC}:clay ratio decreases with decreasing soil structure quality. The {SOC}:clay ratio of 1:8 is the average for a very good structure quality. A {SOC}:clay ratio of 1:10 is the limit between good and medium structural quality, thus it constitutes a reasonable goal for soil management by farmers. A {SOC}:clay ratio of 1:8 or smaller leads to a high probability of poor structural state. These ratios can be used as criteria for soil structural quality and {SOC} management, and in that context, the concept of complexed organic carbon appears relevant.},

            Soil organic carbon ({SOC}) fashions soil structure, which is a key factor of soil fertility. Existing {SOC} content recommendations are based on {SOC}:clay ratio thresholds of {\textgreater}1:10. However, the corresponding {SOC} content might be considered hard to reach in clayey soils, whose structure degradation risk is assumed to be high. Here, we analysed the {SOC} content and soil structure quality of soils under similar cropping practices with clay contents ranging from 16\% to 52\%. Five undisturbed soil cores (5–10 cm layer) were collected from 96 fields at 58 farms in the Swiss Jura region. We assessed the soil structure quality visually using the {CoreVESS} method. Gravimetric air content and water content, and bulk density at −100 {hPa} were also measured, and the soil structure degradation index was calculated. We found that the relationship between {SOC} and clay content held over the clay content range, suggesting that reaching an acceptable {SOC}:clay ratio is not limited by large clay contents. This suggests that the 1:10 {SOC}:clay ratio may remain useful for clayey soils. In contrast to what was expected, it is not more challenging to reach this ratio in clayey soils even if it implies reaching very large {SOC} contents. {SOC} content explained the considered physical properties better than clay content. From a soil management point of view, these findings suggest that the soil texture determines a potential {SOC} content, while the {SOC}:clay ratio is determined by farming practices regardless of the clay content.},

Changes in exudate composition could have impacts on the plant itself, on other plants, on soil properties (e.g. amount of soil organic matter), and on soil organisms. The effects of drought on the composition of root exudates, however, have been rarely studied. We used an ecometabolomics approach to identify the compounds in the exudates of Quercus ilex (holm oak) under an experimental drought gradient and subsequent recovery. Increasing drought stress strongly affected the composition of the exudate metabolome. Plant exudates under drought consisted mainly of secondary metabolites (71\% of total metabolites) associated with plant responses to drought stress, whereas the metabolite composition under recovery shifted towards a dominance of primary metabolites (81\% of total metabolites). These results strongly suggested that roots exude the most abundant root metabolites. The exudates were changed irreversibly by the lack of water under extreme drought conditions, and the plants could not recover.},

	abstract = {During their life, plant roots release organic compounds in their surrounding environment. This process, named rhizodeposition, is of ecological importance because (1) it is a loss of reduced C for the plant, (2) it is an input flux for the organic C pool of the soil and (3) it fuels the soil microflora, which is involved in the great majority of the biological activity of soils such as the nutrient and pollutant cycling or the dynamics of soil borne pathogens, for example. The present review first examines the mechanisms by which major rhizodeposits are released into the soil: production of root cap cells, secretion of mucilage, passive and controlled diffusion of root exudates. In a second part, results from tracer studies (43 articles) are analysed and values of C flux from the plant root into the soil are summarized. In average, 17\% of the net C fixed by photosynthesis is lost by roots and recovered as rhizosphere respiration (12\%) and soil residues (5\%), which corresponds to 50\% of the C exported by shoots to belowground. Finally, the paper reviews major factors that modify the partitioning of photoassimilates to the soil: microorganisms, nitrogen, soil texture and atmospheric {CO}2 concentration.},

	abstract = {Root exudates, as an important form of material input from plants to the soil, regulate the carbon input and efflux of plant rhizosphere soil and play an important role in maintaining the carbon and nutrient balance of the whole ecosystem. Root exudates are notoriously difficult to collect due to their underlying characteristics (e.g., low concentration and fast turnover rate) and the associated methodological challenges of accurately measuring root exudates in native soils. As a result, up until now, it has been difficult to accurately quantify the soil organic carbon input from root exudates to the soil in most studies. In recent years, the contribution and ecological effects of root exudates to soil organic carbon input and efflux have been paid more and more attention. However, the ecological mechanism of soil organic carbon input and efflux mediated by root exudates are rarely analyzed comprehensively. In this review, the main processes and influencing factors of soil organic carbon input and efflux mediated by root exudates are demonstrated. Soil minerals and soil microbes play key roles in the processes. The carbon allocation from plants to soil is influenced by the relationship between root exudates and root functional traits. Compared with the quantity of root exudates, the response of root exudate quality to environmental changes affects soil carbon function more. In the future, the contribution of root exudates in different plants to soil carbon turnover and their relationship with soil nutrient availability will be accurately quantified, which will be helpful to understand the mechanism of soil organic carbon sequestration.},
